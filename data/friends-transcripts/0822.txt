 [Scene: Central Perk, Joey is showing everyone a poster as Ross enters.] 
  Ross:  Hey! What are you guys looking at? 
  Joey:  Oh, it&#146;s a poster for that World War I movie that I&#146;m in, check
it out. 
  Ross:  Yeah? Wow! It looks  really  violent! 
  Joey:  Uh-huh! I know. I&#146;m coming soon to a theater near you! I&#146;m in
THX! I&#146;m unsuitable for children! 
  Ross:  Now I cannot wait to see this. 
  Joey:  Yeah, yeah, it&#146;s already generating Oscar buzz. 
  Phoebe:  I started that! 
  Joey:  I thought I did! Oh hey guess what? The premiere is next week and
you&#146;re all invited! (They all gasp.) 
  Monica:  Are we gonna take a limo? 
  Joey:  Sure! Why not?! 
  Monica:  Oh I love taking limos when nobody died! 
  Rachel:  Well obviously I won&#146;t be able to come, for those of you who
haven&#146;t checked their calendars today is my due date. Well y&#146;know, I just want
to take a moment and thank you guys for how great you&#146;ve been during this time. I
really couldn&#146;t have done it without you. And I have  loved  these last nine
months! And even though I am so looking forward to the next part, I am really gonna miss
being pregnant. 
 [Scene: Central Perk, time lapse, and Rachel is entering still pregnant.] 
  Rachel:  That&#146;s right, still no baby! (To Monica, Joey, and Chandler on the
couch) Come on people! Please make some room! 
  Ross:  Uh sweetie, maybe you&#146;d be more comfortable here? (Gets up from the
green armchair.) 
  Rachel:  You. Like you haven&#146;t done enough. 
  Ross:  Look, I-I know how miserable you are, I wish there was something I can do.
I mean I wish I were a seahorse. (She glares at him) Because with seahorses it&#146;s the
male, they carry the babies. And then also umm, I&#146;d be far away in the sea. (He sits
back down.) 
 (Rachel turns and looks at the group on the couch and they move over. Chandler measures
the room they&#146;ve made with his arm and decides it&#146;s not enough and they all move
over again.) 
  Rachel:  God. (Sits down.) I have never been so uncomfortable in my entire life! 
  Phoebe:  Oh I know, I&#146;ve been there. I remember toward the end&#133; 
  Rachel:  (interrupting her) Oh Phoebe, that&#146;s a great story. Can you tell it
to me when you&#146;re getting me some iced tea? (Phoebe gets up and Rachel groans.) (To
the baby) Oh God, get out! Get out!! Get out!! Get out!! 
  Chandler:  Let&#146;s. (Everyone gets up and leaves Rachel.) 
  Opening Credits  
 [Scene: Monica and Chandler's, Phoebe, Chandler, Joey, and Monica are there as Rachel
enters.] 
  Chandler:  Hey! Did you have the baby yet? 
  Rachel:  Do you want me to come over there and sit on you? &#145;Cause I&#146;ll
do it. 
  Monica:  What are you doing here so early? 
  Rachel:  They sent me home from work. They were like, Start your maternity
leave now! Just rest, get ready for the baby. Well y&#146;know what? Screw &#145;em!
If they don&#146;t want me there, I&#146;ll just hang out with you guys. 
  Phoebe:  Or you can do  volunteer  work. 
 (Joey&#146;s cell phone rings and he answers it.) 
  Joey:  Hello? 
  Estelle:  Joey! It&#146;s Estelle! Great news, I was able to get you and one
guest tickets to your premiere. 
  Joey:  One guest? You told me I can have six tickets! 
  Estelle:  Well, I sold four of them on  Ebay . You&#146;ll be sitting next
to HotGuy372. 
  Joey:  Oh my God. So that&#146;s it?! I only get to bring one guest? 
  Estelle:  Yeah, what time do you wanna pick me up? (Joey hangs up on her.) Hello? 
  Joey:  (to Monica, Chandler, and Phoebe) Did you hear that? I only get one extra
ticket to my premiere. So some how I have to pick between you three and Ross. 
  Rachel:  (overhearing that) What-what about me? 
  Joey:  You said you didn&#146;t want to go. 
  Rachel:  I don&#146;t. But I would still like to be acknowledged. What? Just
because I&#146;m pregnant you think I&#146;m invisible. 
  Joey:  Definitely not invisible. 
  Monica:  Well, well Ross didn&#146;t care enough to be here, so I think he&#146;s
out. You snooze you lose. 
  Chandler:  He&#146;s not snoozing, he&#146;s teaching a class. 
  Monica:  Well then somebody&#146;s snoozing. Joey, not that this uh should affect
you at all, but if you were to pick me, I was planning on wearing a sequined dress, cut
down to here. (Points to her stomach just above her belly button.) 
  Chandler:  I haven&#146;t seen this dress. 
  Monica:  Star in a movie. 
  Phoebe:  Joey, you pick who ever you want. Okay? You just listen to your heart.
What does it tell you? (Mimicking a heartbeat and tapping her chest.) Phoebe, Phoebe. 
  Joey:  Well uh&#133;I think I want to take Chandler. 
  Phoebe:  (still mimicking a heartbeat, only faster)
Phoebe-Phoebe-Phoebe-Phoebe&#151;Burrrrr! (Mimics the sound of a cardiac monitor going
off.) 
  Chandler:  You really want to take me? 
  Joey:  Yeah! Yeah! I mean I&#146;m sorry, I wish I can take everybody, but
y&#146;know Chandler always supported my career. He&#146;s paid for acting classes and
head shots and stuff and well this will be my way of paying you back. 
  Chandler:  So you&#146;re never actually going to pay me back? 
  Monica:  Wait a minute, just because he paid for your head shots you&#146;re
gonna take him? Joey, I don&#146;t think you&#146;re comprehending just how slutty this
dress is! 
  Joey:  It&#146;s not just the stuff he paid for, I mean it&#146;s-it&#146;s
everything. Y&#146;know? He read lines with me. He-he went with me on auditions when I was
really nervous, and then he consoled me after I didn&#146;t get parts that I really
wanted. You always believed in me man. Even, even when I didn&#146;t believe in myself. 
  Chandler:  I always knew you were gonna make it. I&#146;m so proud of you. 
  Joey:  Thanks. That means a lot to me. 
 (They look at each other and smile for a while.) 
  Phoebe:  Mon, maybe one of these guys wants to wear your dress. 
  Joey:  (in a manly voice) I&#146;m gonna go shave. (Gets up.) 
  Chandler:  (in a manly voice) Yeah well, I&#146;m gonna go spit. (He goes into
the bedroom. On his way out, Joey gives Rachel a wide berth.) 
  Rachel:  Oh, I have to pee. If I don&#146;t come out in five minutes it&#146;s
because I&#146;ve choked to death on the potpourri stink. (Goes into the bathroom.) 
  Phoebe:  When she comes out, you hold her nose, I&#146;ll blow in her mouth, and
the kid will just (makes a popping sound) right out of her. 
  Monica:  She&#146;s over a week late! She gotta have it today, right? 
  Phoebe:  I don&#146;t know. I-I think it&#146;s still gonna be a while. 
  Monica:  Hmm, care to make it interesting? I&#146;ll bet you that she&#146;ll
have it by this time tomorrow. 
  Phoebe:  You&#146;re on! 
  Monica:  Okay, how much? 
  Phoebe:  One  hundred  thousand dollars! 
  Monica:  How about fifty bucks? 
  Phoebe:  Fine! I&#146;ll call Zurich and move some money around. 
  Rachel:  (calling from the bathroom) All right, who&#146;s turn is it to help me
get up! 
 (They both look at each other, then Phoebe gets an idea.) 
  Phoebe:  No one&#146;s here! (Monica looks at her.) Oh damnit! 
 [Scene: The World Premiere of Over There, Joey and Chandler are arriving in a limo and
are about to walk down the red carpet.] 
  Chandler:  This is so exciting! It&#146;s so glamorous! People taking our
picture. How do I look? 
  Joey:  A little tall. 
  Chandler:  What? 
  Joey:  Do you mind crouching down a little bit, so that I look taller? (Chandler
does so) There you go. (And they walk down the red carpet.) 
  Chandler:  It&#146;s just so glamorous. 
 [Scene: Monica and Chandler's, Rachel is entering, still pregnant.] 
  Phoebe:  Oh hey Mon? Rach is here! Ohh, you&#146;re still pregnant. Oh, I&#146;m
sorry. I know how uncomfortable you are. Y&#146;know what? You look great. Yeah, like
fifty bucks. 
  Rachel:  Oh, I have to go pee. Apparently this baby thinks that my bladder is a
squeeze toy. (Goes to the bathroom.) 
  Monica:  Damnit! Damnit!! Here&#146;s your fifty bucks! (Pays Phoebe.) 
  Phoebe:  It&#146;s interesting that you lost. Now, I forget, do you like to lose? 
  Monica:  Now stop it! Double or nothing that she has it by tomorrow! 
  Phoebe:  Fine! You&#146;re on! 
  Monica:  Okay. 
  Phoebe:  Until then, General Grant, why don&#146;t you set up camp (She puts the
bill in her bra) right there. 
  Ross:  (entering) Hey is Rachel here? We have a doctor&#146;s appointment. 
  Monica:  She&#146;s in the bathroom. 
  Ross:  Rach, we gotta go. 
  Rachel:  In a minute!!! 
  Ross:  People ask me why we&#146;re not together, I just don&#146;t know what to
tell them. 
  Rachel:  (entering) All right, all right. Let&#146;s go! 
  Ross:  Uh, do you wanna go change first? The doctor&#146;s keeping the office
open late for us, but if you hurry&#133; 
  Rachel:  No, I&#146;m fine. 
  Ross:  Really? You don&#146;t think that&#146;s a little inappropriate.
(She&#146;s wearing a tank top and has her belly sticking out.) 
  Phoebe:  Good God man don&#146;t anger it. 
  Rachel:  Ross, it is 100 degrees outside. For the first time in weeks, I am
somewhat comfortable. 
  Ross:  Fine! Fine! Y&#146;know what? Whatever you want. Okay? You&#146;re the
mommy. 
  Rachel:  Oh uh-uh pal! Don&#146;t call me mommy! It&#146;s bad enough you call
your own mother that. (He looks at Monica.) 
  Monica:  I&#146;m actually with her on this one. 
 [Scene: Inside Joey&#146;s Premiere, he is intently watching the movie.] 
  Joey:  (onscreen) I thought I knew who the enemy was, but it was you all
along.  
  Joey:  (To Chandler) Okay, this is it. It&#146;s my big fight scene coming up.
(He looks over and Chandler and notices that he&#146;s asleep.) 
 [Scene: Dr. Long&#146;s Office, Ross and Rachel are waiting for the doctor. Ross is
drumming his fingers on the bed.] 
  Rachel:  Ross. 
  Ross:  Yeah? 
  Rachel:  Can I ask you something? 
  Ross:  Uh-huh. 
  Rachel:  When Carol was pregnant with Ben&#133; 
  Ross:  Mmm? 
  Rachel:  &#133;were you this irritating? 
  Ross:  Wow! 
  Rachel:  Excuse me?! 
  Ross:  Oh nothing. Nothing! Just uh, you&#146;ve been a little short with me
lately. I&#146;m not trying to irritate you. 
  Rachel:  Well then you just must have a natural talent for it. 
  Ross:  Y&#146;know what? The doctor will be in soon, why don&#146;t we not speak
until then. 
  Rachel:  (silently) Okay. (Pause) Seriously, breathe louder Ross! That&#146;s
great! 
  Ross:  Y&#146;know we should probably ask the doctor if she even knows how to
deliver a baby that&#146;s half human and half pure evil! 
 (Dr. Long enters.) 
  Rachel:  Hi Dr. Long, how are you? 
  Ross:  (to Rachel) Oh, you&#146;re nice to her. 
  Rachel:  She has the drugs! 
  Dr. Long:  We&#146;ll do a quick check. 
  Rachel:  Okay. (Rachel lies back.) 
  Dr. Long:  So, eight days late huh? 
  Rachel:  Yeah. 
  Dr. Long:  You must be a little uncomfortable. 
  Rachel:  Eh, just a tad. 
  Dr. Long:  You&#146;re about 80 percent effaced, so you&#146;re on your way. It
still could last a little while longer. If you&#146;re anxious there are a few ways to
help things along. 
  Ross:  Do them!! 
  Dr. Long:  Actually, they&#146;re things you can do. Just some home remedies, but
in my experience I&#146;ve found that some of them are quite effective. 
  Rachel:  Well, we are ready to try anything. 
  Dr. Long:  Okay, there&#146;s an herbal tea you can drink. 
  Rachel:  Okay. 
  Dr. Long:  You can take some caster oil, there&#146;s eating spicy foods&#133; 
  Rachel:  Great! We will do all of those. 
  Dr. Long:  &#133;taking a long walk, and then there&#146;s the one that&#146;s
proved most effective: sex. 
 (Rachel turns and looks at Ross.) 
  Ross:  You&#146;ve got to be kidding me! 
  Commercial Break  
 [Scene: Joey&#146;s Premiere, the movie is ending and it takes the applause to wake up
Chandler.] 
  Chandler:  Good job Joe! Well done! Top notch! 
  Joey:  You liked it? You really liked it? 
  Chandler:  Oh-ho-ho, yeah! 
  Joey:  Which part exactly? 
  Chandler:  The whole thing! Can we go? 
  Joey:  Oh no-no-no, give me some specifics. 
  Chandler:  I love the specifics, the specifics were the best part! 
  Joey:  Hey, what about the scene with the kangaroo? Did-did you like that part? 
  Chandler:  I was surprised to see a kangaroo in a World War I epic. 
  Joey:  You fell asleep!! There was no kangaroo! They didn&#146;t take any of my
suggestions! That&#146;s for coming buddy. I&#146;ll see you later. (Starts to walk out.) 
  Chandler:  Don&#146;t go! I&#146;m sorry. I&#146;m so sorry! (Sees another guy
who is still asleep.) Look! This guy fell asleep! He fell asleep too! Be mad at him!
(Looks at him more closely.) Or, call an ambulance. 
 [Scene: Central Perk, Ross and Rachel are there as Phoebe and Monica enter.] 
  Monica:  Hey! 
  Ross:  Hey. 
  Rachel:  Hi! 
  Monica:  What did the doctor say? Any news on when the baby will come? 
  Rachel:  No. But she did give us some ideas on how to induce labor. 
  Ross:  Yeah, we tried them all. We went for a walk, uh we tried a special tea,
caster oil, spicy food nothing has worked. 
  Rachel:  Well, there is one thing that we haven&#146;t tried, but someone thinks
that, (mimicking Ross) That will open up a can of worms. 
  Monica:  Well what is it? What is it? If it&#146;s gonna help bring the baby
here, like today. I mean, I think you should do it. 
  Ross:  It&#146;s sex. 
  Monica:  Do it! 
  Ross:  Monica! 
  Monica:  I&#146;m just saying it&#146;s been a really long time for you. I mean,
women have needs. Do it, get yours! 
  Phoebe:  Oh I-I don&#146;t know about that. No, I think that if the two of you
had sex the-the-the repercussions would be catastrophic.  
  Monica:  All right, let&#146;s be practical, if Ross isn&#146;t willing to do it,
he&#146;s not the only guy in the world you can have sex with. You can borrow
Chandler&#151;Chandler is good! 
  Ross:  Monica, what is the matter with you? 
  Monica:  Nothing. I just want the baby to be born today. 
  Rachel:  Why? Why today? 
  Monica:  Okay fine! I keep betting Phoebe that you&#146;re gonna have the baby
and I don&#146;t want to lose again! 
  Ross:  What?! While she&#146;s been going through this hell, you&#146;ve been
making money?! You&#146;re betting on your friend staying in this misery?! (Phoebe lowers
her head and shakes it yes.) 
  Rachel:  I&#146;ll take that bet. 
  Ross:  What?! 
  Rachel:  Well, I&#146;m miserable here! I might as well make some money out it! 
  Ross:  Can I get some of that action? 
  Monica:  Wait a minute! Now I&#146;m betting against all three of you? 
  Rachel:  Oh honey, don&#146;t worry. I really do feel like tomorrow&#146;s the
day. 
  Monica:  Oh, okay! 
 (Rachel turns her head to Ross and Phoebe and mouths, No way.) 
 [Scene: Monica and Chandler's, Chandler is there as Joey enters.] 
  Joey:  Hey! Sleeping beauty! 
  Chandler:  Where have you been?! I tried to call you! I want to talk to you! I
still feel so bad! 
  Joey:  (in a baby voice) Oh no, were you upset? Did you lose sleep? 
  Chandler:  I&#146;m so sorry. 
  Joey:  Uh-huh look, the only reason I can over here was to settle things between
us! Okay? You&#146;ve done a lot for me and my career, I wanted to pay you back so I took
you to the premiere but you missed it! Okay, so how much do I owe you? 
  Chandler:  What?! 
  Joey:  Give me a number, I don&#146;t want to owe you anything! 
  Chandler:  You don&#146;t owe me anything, I don&#146;t want you money&#133; 
  Joey:  Ah-ah-ah! We&#146;re doing this! Okay, now you got me my first set of head
shots. Right, how much were those? 
  Chandler:  I don&#146;t know, five hundred dollars? 
  Joey:  Okay, five hundred dollars. What else? 
  Chandler:  Well then there was the second set, the infamous booger head shots. 
  Joey:  Okay, so that&#146;s another five hundred. Five hundred and five hundred,
that&#146;s&#133; (Pauses to figure it out.) 
  Chandler:  Do you want a calculator? 
  Joey:  Please!  
  Chandler:  Here! (Hands him one. Joey adds it up and discovers that he was
right.) 
  Joey:  All right, what else? 
  Chandler:  Well uh, there was acting classes, stage combat classes, tap
classes&#133; 
  Joey:  Which we&#146;re still keeping under our hats! 
  Chandler:  Uh then there was that dialect coach who helped you with that play
where you needed a southern accent. Which after twenty hours of lessons still came out
Jamaican.  
  Joey:  What the hell are you talking about, (in a Jamaican accent) The
south will rise again man. 
  Chandler:  Yes, money well spent! 
  Joey:  Yeah. Okay, what else? Rent! 
  Chandler:  Okay, two, three years of rent, utilities, food&#133; 
  Joey:  Okay. Okay, so I&#146;m writing you a check for&#133;So you fell asleep
during my movie. Big deal right? How do you clear this thing? 
 [Scene: Ross and Rachel's, Ross and Rachel are trying the home remedies again.] 
  Ross:  Come on, finish your enchilada. 
  Rachel:  Ross I&#151;We tried all the spicy food. It&#146;s not working. 
  Ross:  Okay here, have one of these peppers. Oh ha&#133; Oh God! So&#133;so hot!
(Rubs his eyes.) Oh my&#151;(Laughs.) By the way, you don&#146;t want to touch the pepper
and then touch your eye. 
  Rachel:  I am feeling nothing. Speaking of hot, watching you do that really makes
me want to have sex with you. 
  Ross:  Stop it. 
  Rachel:  Oh come on Ross, why are we wasting our time with this other stuff?! We
know what&#146;s gonna work! It&#146;s doctor recommended! 
  Ross:  I&#146;m sorry, but we have to have some boundaries! My God, I&#146;m
dying. 
  Rachel:  Oh come on Ross, we&#146;ve done it before we&#146;ll do it again,
it&#146;ll be a nice way to bookend the pregnancy. 
  Ross:  This is insane, I&#146;m not gonna make love to you just so that
you&#146;ll go into labor. 
  Rachel:  Make love? What are you a girl? 
  Ross:  Always a great way to get in a man&#146;s pants. 
  Rachel:  But you will, you will be performing a service. Okay? Just-just think of
me as a ketchup bottle, y&#146;know you sometimes you have to bang on the end of it just
to get something to come out. 
  Ross:  I love when you talk dirty to me. 
  Rachel:  Oh, I know it. You&#146;re right. That&#146;s not sexy. Oh&#133;Oh!
(Drops a fork on the floor.) Whoops! Oh, I seem to have dropped my fork. Let me just bed
over and get it. (Tries too, but can&#146;t quite seem to make it.) Oh God! 
  Ross:  Okay enough! This is, this is not going to happen. 
  Rachel:  Come on Ross! I&#146;m miserable here! Come on! You started this, now
you finish it! Come on wuss, make love to me. 
  Ross:  Y&#146;know what? 
  Rachel:  What?! 
  Ross:  Forget it. 
  Rachel:  Oh wow! What now Ross you&#146;re not gonna talk? How on earth will you
ever annoy me? Oh wait a minute, I know. (Mimics his breathing.) I mean you&#146;d think
the damn jalepeno would&#146;ve cleared up your sinuses, but no!! That&#146;s not
enough&#133; (Ross jumps over and kisses her.) What are you doing?! 
  Ross:  I&#146;m getting that baby out of you! 
 (They kiss again.) 
  Rachel:  (breaking the kiss) Oh God! 
  Ross:  Oh, I know. 
  Rachel:  Oh no. No-no! I think my water just broke. 
  Ross:  I am good. Okay! Okay! Uh, I got the pillow! I got the bag! You got the
keys? 
  Rachel:  Okay! I got the keys! Okay! Okay! 
  Ross:  Hey! 
  Rachel:  Yeah. 
  Ross:  We&#146;re having a baby. 
 (They hug and then kiss one more time.) 
  Rachel:  I didn&#146;t uh, really have time to read this part of the books, but
do you think we have time to&#133; 
  Ross:  Not so much. 
  Rachel:  Okay. 
  Closing Credits  
 [Scene: Monica and Chandler's, Monica is paying Phoebe.] 
  Monica:  Two hundred. 
  Phoebe:  Thank you! 
  Monica:  That&#146;s it. I&#146;m done. I don&#146;t care when the baby comes, no
more betting. 
  Phoebe:  Okay. 
 (The phone rings and Monica answers it.) 
  Monica:  Hello? (Listens) Uh-huh. (Listens) Uh-huh. (Listens) Okay. (Hangs up.) I
guess we can bet one more time. 
  Phoebe:  Is Rachel having the baby? 
  Monica:  How did you know that?! (Runs to yell at Joey&#146;s apartment.) Joey!
Chandler!! It&#146;s time! 
  Phoebe:  They&#146;re at the coffeehouse. 
  Monica:  You know everything!! Oh wait, double or nothing. I bet you the baby is
over seven pounds. (Phoebe isn&#146;t interested.) I bet you it has hair. (She&#146;s
still not interested.) I bet you it&#146;s a girl. 
  Phoebe:  We know it&#146;s a girl! (Exits.) 
  Monica:  (following her) I&#146;ll give you really good odds. 
  End
