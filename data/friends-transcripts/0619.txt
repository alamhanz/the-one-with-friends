 [Scene: Joey and now Rachel's apartment, Joey has the fridge pulled out away from the
wall and is in the process of pulling off the cooling grate behind it.] 
  Joey:  Well that thing is clearing in the way! All right. Ah-ha! (He grabs a
screwdriver and starts to attack the compressor, only he causes a small short circuit and
shocks himself.) Ah-ah!! Damn fridge!  
 (Rachel enters from her new room.) 
  Rachel:  Hi Joey, how ya doin&#146;? 
  Joey:  Great! Roomie! 
  Rachel:  Huh, yeah I guess we are roommates now. 
  Joey:  Yeah! Well, now that you brought it up, our fridge is broken. We have to
get a new one. Now, I checked around and your half is $400. Thanks a lot. 
  Rachel:  I&#146;m not paying for half of that! I&#146;m only staying here until
my apartment gets fixed. 
  Joey:  Look Rach, my parents bought this fridge just after I was born, okay? Now,
I have  never  had a problem with it. Then you show up and it breaks! What does that
tell ya&#146;? 
  Rachel:  That refrigerators don&#146;t live as long as people. 
  Joey:  All right, now you know that the ATM will only lets you take out 300 at a
time, I&#146;ll take a check for the other hundred. 
  Rachel:  You&#146;re jokin&#146; right? 
  Joey:  Of course I&#146;m jokin&#146;! I don&#146;t take checks. 
  Rachel:  Thank God you&#146;re pretty. (Exits.) 
  Opening Credits  
 [Scene: Central Perk, Joey, Chandler, Monica, and Phoebe are there as Rachel enters.] 
  Rachel:  Hey! 
  All:  Hi! Hey! 
  Rachel:  Do you guys know any cute guys? 
  Chandler:  Well, of course I do! My good friend Joey over here. (Pats Joey&#146;s
arm, Joey pats Chandler&#146;s shoulder, and Chandler motions for Joey to say the same
about him.) 
  Joey:  Oh, I&#146;m sorry. Thank you Chandler. 
  Rachel:  Anyway, there&#146;s this big charity ball this weekend and Ralph Lauren
bought a table, so I kinda have to go&#133; 
  Monica:  What&#146;s the charity? 
  Rachel:  I don&#146;t know, something either trees or disease&#151;Ralph mumbles
a lot. 
  Monica:  Does Ralph mumble when you&#146;re not paying attention? 
  Rachel:  Yeah! It&#146;s weird. But the thing is need to find a date. 
  Phoebe:  Well, what kind of guy are you looking for? 
  Rachel:  Well, someone that has his own tux, or has the ability to  rent  a
tux. 
  Chandler:  So he has to be a male who has at least $50. 
  Joey:  Ooh! So close. 
 (Ross and Elizabeth enter.) 
  Ross:  Hey everybody! 
  All:  Hi! 
  Ross:  Hey uh, this is Elizabeth. 
  Elizabeth:  Oh hi! 
  All:  Hi! 
  Elizabeth:  I&#146;m the student. 
  Chandler:  (laughs) Isn&#146;t she cute? (On Monica&#146;s death stare) No! 
  Phoebe:  Y&#146;know, this is probably none of my business, but weren&#146;t you
guys supposed to not be seen in public together? 
  Elizabeth:  Oh, we&#146;re not together. 
  Ross:  Oh no-no-no, we&#146;re just two people who happen to run into each other
here at the coffee house. (He winks at her.) 
  Phoebe:  Oh, sly. 
  Elizabeth:  Well, I really wanted to meet you guys, but I have to run. I&#146;ll
see you later? 
  All:  Okay! 
  Elizabeth:  Bye Ross. 
  Ross:  Bye. 
 (They kiss.) 
  Elizabeth:  Oops! I did not mean to run into you like that sir. 
  Ross:  Oh that is quite all right ma&#146;am. (Elizabeth exits.) 
  Chandler:  So, why is she leaving? Is it a school night and she has a lot of
homework to do? 
  Ross:  Yes, her molecular epidemiology paper is due tomorrow. 
  Chandler:  Oh, tell her good luck with that. 
  Ross:  Anyone else? Huh? Bring &#145;em on! 
  Rachel:  Oo! When&#146;s her birthday?! 
  Ross:  I don&#146;t know Rachel, why? 
  Rachel:  Well, y&#146;know it&#146;s just been so long since I&#146;ve been to  Chuckie
Cheese . 
  Monica:  Oh, I like Elizabeth. 
  Ross:  Well thanks! 
  Monica:  Yeah. In fact, I like her so much you tell her I want my cookies early
this year! Y&#146;know, a box of  Thin Mints  and some  Tag-a-Longs . 
  Joey:  Hey-hey come on you guys, give him a break. Ross, seriously, how&#146;s it
going with her? 
  Ross:  Well, actually it&#146;s been great. She&#146;s 20 so she&#146;s not
looking for anything too serious, which is perfect for me right now. 
  Monica:  Well that is great. And seriously, she seems very nice. 
  Ross:  Thanks. I know you guys like to give me a hard time and all, but it really
means a lot to me that you like her. Just knowing that you guys are&#133; 
  Phoebe:  (interrupting) Okay, I got a good one. Okay, umm, what is she? Like 12? 
 [Scene: Monica, Chandler, and Phoebe's, Chandler is sitting at the table and Monica is
doing something in the kitchen.] 
  Monica:  Chandler, do you think we talk about our relationship enough? 
  Chandler:  Yeah. Do we have any  Fruit Roll-Ups ? 
  Phoebe:  (entering) Hey! 
  Monica:  Hey! 
  Phoebe:  Okay, I just thought of the perfect guy for Rachel to take to her thing. 
  Chandler:  Oh that&#146;s so funny because we found someone too. 
  Phoebe:  Oh that&#146;s good, I guess she&#146;ll have a choice between my guy
and your weirdo. 
  Chandler:  Why would our guy be a weirdo? 
  Phoebe:  &#145;Cause that&#146;s just your taste. 
  Monica:  (laughs sarcastically) Rachel is not going to pick your stupid guy. 
  Phoebe:  Oh yeah? 
  Monica:  Yeah! 
  Phoebe:  My guy is a lawyer who has volunteer work. And, he has one of these (She
squeezes the skin on her chin together to form&#133;) 
  Chandler:  A face ass? 
  Phoebe:  A chin dimple! 
  Monica:  Well, uh y&#146;know, our guy works with Chandler and he&#146;s really
nice and smart and he&#146;s a great dresser! 
  Phoebe:  Have you seen your guy&#146;s body? 
  Chandler:  No, our guy is just a floating head. 
  Phoebe:  Well my guy is spectacular. Okay? He&#146;s a massage client and one
time umm, when he was on the table, I looked at it. And I mean all of it. 
  Monica:  You&#146;re not supposed to look! 
  Phoebe:  Oh yeah, like there are police for that! 
  Chandler:  (horrified) Wait! You look? You-you massaged me. 
  Phoebe:  I know. (Laughs.) 
  Monica:  All right fine, your guy may have a great body, but our guy is really
funny. 
  Phoebe:  Oh, Chandler funny? 
  Monica:  Our guy&#146;s a great dancer! 
  Phoebe:  My guy is well read. 
  Chandler:  Our guy has great hair. 
  Phoebe:  My guy has great teeth! 
  Chandler:  Our guy smells incredible. 
  Monica:  (To Chandler) Do you want our guy to be your guy? 
 [Scene: Joey and Rachel's apartment, Chandler is entering to find Joey bingeing on the
food from the fridge. Joey isn&#146;t doing all that well.] 
  Chandler:  Hey. 
  Joey:  Huh. 
  Chandler:  Well, you&#133;don&#146;t look good Joe. 
  Joey:  The fridge broke. I have to eat everything. Cold cuts, ice cream,
limes&#151;Hey, what was in that brown jar? 
  Chandler:  That&#146;s still in there?! 
  Joey:  Not anymore. So anyway, how do you want to pay me? 
  Chandler:  Is this a service you&#146;re providing me? 
  Joey:  No! No! No! For my new fridge&#151;our new fridge! 
  Chandler:   Our  new fridge? I don&#146;t live here anymore. 
  Joey:  So what? Look, suppose we were a divorced couple. 
  Chandler:  Uh-huh. 
  Joey:  And I got custody of the kid, right? Now suppose the kid dies and-and I
gotta buy a new kid. 
  Chandler:  (not quite sure where Joey&#146;s going and is a little worried)
Okay&#133; 
  Joey:  (pause) Give me $400! 
 [Scene: Ross&#146;s office, he&#146;s unlocking his office door as Elizabeth walks up.] 
  Elizabeth:  Professor Geller? 
  Ross:  Hmm? (Turns around and sees that its Elizabeth) Oh, a student I don&#146;t
know. 
  Elizabeth:  I was wondering if I could talk to you for a moment? 
  Ross:  Yes, yes of course, what-what would this be regarding? 
  Elizabeth:  Making out in your office. 
  Ross:  Shh! (Laughs then composes himself) Of course, why don&#146;t we go
inside? 
 (They go inside and Ross closes the door. When he turns around Elizabeth walks up to
him, pushes him back against the door, and starts kissing him.) 
  Ross:  Oh-ooh! 
  Elizabeth:  What? 
  Ross:  Doorknob! Doorknob! 
  Elizabeth:  Oh! Sorry! Umm, I actually do need to talk to you. 
  Ross:  Oh, okay. What-what about? 
  Elizabeth:  Spring vacation. 
  Ross:  Spring vacation. 
  Elizabeth:  Yeah, we have time off and a lot of people are going on trips&#133; 
 (Another professor barges in.) 
  Professor Feesen:  Professor Geller! 
  Ross:  (quickly jumping away from Elizabeth) Yes, professor
Feesen-sen-stenlger&#133; I&#146;ll be with you in one moment. (To Elizabeth) So, I will
take one box of the  Thin Mints . (And he ushers Elizabeth out of the office.) 
 [Scene: Joey and Rachel's apartment, Ross, Chandler, and Joey are entering.] 
  Ross:  You don&#146;t understand! Elizabeth was about to ask me to go on a trip
with her! Is that taking it slow?! No, I&#146;m not ready for this! Okay? What-what do I
tell her? 
  Chandler:  Just tell her the truth! Tell her you&#146;re not ready. 
  Ross:  I can do that. Oh-oh, what if she gets upset? 
  Chandler:  Then you distract her with a  Barbie  doll. 
  Joey:  Or! You can just, y&#146;know&#133; (He walks up close to whisper in
Ross&#146;s ear and when he gets there he pushes Ross into the fridge.) 
  Ross:  What the hell are you doing? 
  Joey:  What? What the hell am  I  doing? You just broke my fridge! 
  Ross:  What?! What? How do you, how do you even know its broken?! 
  Joey:  Oh-ho-ho, you think I don&#146;t know what breaks my fridge? Excuse me!
(He opens the door and feels inside.) Well what do you know! Broken! That&#146;ll be $400! 
  Chandler:  Joey, I  saw  you push him! 
  Joey:  (pause) You pushed him! 
  Ross:  Joey, I did not break this! Okay? (He opens the freezer and smells inside
and recoils in disgust.)  That  has been broken for a while. 
  Joey:  All right. Chandler, do you remember how I told you about our fridge? 
  Chandler:  Uh-huh. 
  Joey:  I still haven&#146;t gotten a check for your half yet. 
  Ross:  Do  not  give him any money! 
  Joey:  I&#146;m not talking to you! You broke my fridge! 
 [Scene: Ross&#146;s office, he&#146;s opening the door to Elizabeth.] 
  Elizabeth:  You wanted to see me Professor Geller? 
  Ross:  Yes. Yes! Please, come in. 
 (She does so, he closes the door, and she pushes him against the doorknob again.) 
  Ross:  Oo-oo! 
  Elizabeth:  Doorknob? 
  Ross:  Yeah, it kinda grows on you. (They both laugh.) Actually, I wanted to
finish talking to you about uh, spring vacation. 
  Elizabeth:  Oh good. 
  Ross:  Look, I&#133; (He has trouble sitting in his chair.) Look, I&#146;m having
a great time with you and I just don&#146;t want us to move to fast or put to much
pressure on us. So, I&#146;m sorry I just don&#146;t think we should go away together yet.
It&#146;s-it&#146;s too soon. 
  Elizabeth:  Ross, I think you misunderstood what I was saying. I just wanted to
tell you that I&#146;m going to Florida for a couple weeks. 
  Ross:  No. I think you misunderstood what  I  was saying. What I meant
was&#133; 
  Elizabeth:  You are so adorable. 
  Ross:  That! Let&#146;s talk about that. 
 [Scene: Central Perk, Monica, Chandler, and Phoebe are there as Ross enters.] 
  Ross:  Hey! 
  Chandler:  Hey! 
  Phoebe:  Hey! 
  Monica:  Hey! How did it go with Elizabeth? 
  Ross:  Huh? Oh-oh, it was fine. Uh, it was just a misunderstanding. She
didn&#146;t want me to go with her. She just wanted to let me know that she&#146;s going
to Florida for spring vacation. 
  Chandler:  Wait a minute, is she going for spring vacation or is she going for
spring break? (Does a little whooping/party noise.) 
  Ross:  What&#146;s-what&#146;s the difference? 
  Monica:  Well, spring vacation is doing nice things with your grandparents.
Spring break you&#146;re doing frat guys. 
  Ross:  Hey, y&#146;know what? Not all spring breaks are like that. 
  Phoebe:  What did you do on yours? 
  Ross:  I went to Egypt with my dad. 
  Chandler:  I can see it now, Look dad, it&#146;s the Sphinx! (Does
that party noise again.) 
  Ross:  Hey, I think Elizabeth is a little more serious than, Spring
break! (Imitates the party noise.) All right? I mean she&#146;s taken my class! 
  Monica:  And slept with the professor. 
  Ross:  I&#146;m gonna call her. 
  Chandler:  Yeah. 
 (Ross leaves to do so and Rachel enters with a guy.) 
  Rachel:  Hey! You guys umm, I want you to meet Sebastian. 
  Sebastian:  Hi. 
  Rachel:  We just uh, we just met at the newsstand. We both grabbed for the last  Field
 Stream . (Chandler&#146;s shocked.) What? I read that. 
  Sebastian:  Can I get you a cup of coffee? 
  Rachel:  Oh yes! Thank you! (He does so and Rachel sits down on the couch.) 
  Phoebe:  Rachel, what the hell is this?! 
  Rachel:  (shocked) What? 
  Phoebe:  You ask us to find you a guy and you come traipsing in here with your
own! 
  Rachel:  You found me a guy? 
  Monica:  Yes! We found you a really cute and funny guy from Chandler&#146;s work! 
  Phoebe:  Yeah and I-I found you one too who is not a weirdo. 
  Rachel:  Well, y&#146;know what though you guys? I really appreciate that but I
think I&#146;m just gonna take Sebastian to the charity. 
  Chandler:  Are you sure?! Because our guy smells incredible! 
  Monica:  Uh, would you  stop  it with that already?! 
 (Sebastian returns with the coffee.) 
  Sebastian:  Here you go. (Hands her, her cup.) 
  Rachel:  Oh, thank you. 
  Sebastian:  Sure. 
  Phoebe:  So, Sebastian, do you do any volunteer work? 
  Sebastian:  Uh, no not really. Why? 
  Phoebe:  No reason, it&#146;s just I know a single guy that cares about other
people. 
  Chandler:  Are you funny? 
  Sebastian:  Excuse me? 
  Rachel:  What are you guys doing? 
  Monica:  Are you funny? Tell us a joke! 
  Sebastian:  Look, I just wanted to have coffee with Rachel. 
  Phoebe:  Well, so do a lot of people. 
  Sebastian:  Actually, I uh, I gotta get going. (To Rachel) Give me a call
sometime. 
  Rachel:  Oh, but y&#146;know, no, you didn&#146;t give me your phone number. 
  Sebastian:  Okay! See you later! (Exits.) 
  Chandler:  (To Monica) Turns out he is kinda funny.  
  Commercial Break  
 [Scene: Central Perk, continued from earlier.] 
  Rachel:  I cannot believe you guys! He was really nice and he left because of
you! 
  Chandler:  Yeah, but Sebastian? What is that? A cat&#146;s name? 
  Phoebe:  Yeah, y&#146;know what I noticed Rachel? He scares easy. Is that the
kind of guy you&#146;d like to take to a ball? Hey Sebastian, would you like to
dance? (Imitates him.) Uhh, okay&#151;I gotta go! 
  Monica:  All right guys stop it. Rachel, we&#146;re very sorry that is a very
insensitive thing for us to do. And y&#146;know what? Let us make it up to you, we have
two really great guys for you. 
  Phoebe:  Yeah! What have you got to lose? Y&#146;know you might even end up with
someone really special (whispers) if you pick my guy. 
  Rachel:  All right. 
  Chandler:  Okay, so you will meet our guys? 
  Rachel:  Yes, I&#146;ll meet &#145;em. 
  Chandler:  Okay now it doesn&#146;t matter which one you choose, y&#146;know?
It&#146;s completely up to you. Our guy is perfect, or you can go out with the guy Phoebe
deemed not good enough to go out with herself. 
  Joey:  (entering) Pheebs! There you are! Okay, you broke my fridge; you owe me
400 bucks! 
  Phoebe:  Okay sure! 
  Joey:  Really?! 
  Phoebe:  Ooh, technically you owe me $600 for sending out happy thoughts on your
last ten auditions. 
  Joey:  Call it even? 
  Phoebe:  Okay. 
 (Ross returns.) 
  Chandler:  (To Ross) Well, there you are! So what did Elizabeth say? 
  Ross:  Well, it turns out that she is going to Daytona for spring break woo-hoo.
That means, that means wet T-shirt contests, guys doing shots off of girl&#146;s bodies,
waking up next to people you don&#146;t even know&#133; 
  Joey:  Man, she is going to have a  great  time! Is she staying at the Hotel
Corona? 
  Chandler:  You know the hotels? 
  Joey:  Sure! I was there! Spring Break &#146;81! Woo-hoo! 
  Monica:  In 1981 you were 13! 
  Joey:  So what? I drove down, sold T-shirts, had a blast. And y&#146;know who
knows how to party? Drunk college chicks. 
  Ross:  Okay, she can&#146;t go. 
  Phoebe:  Ross, you can&#146;t tell her not to go. You just started dating. 
  Ross:  Then what am I supposed to do? 
  Phoebe:  Nothing, you just have to be cool with it. 
  Ross:  Well, what is she goes down and-and sleeps with a bunch of guys? 
  Chandler:  Well, maybe you  don&#146;t  marry this one. 
 [Scene: Elizabeth&#146;s apartment, she is packing for her trip as Ross watches.] 
  Ross:  I&#146;m so glad you&#146;re going on this trip! 
  Elizabeth:  Yeah! I&#146;ve been working so hard this semester. I really need to
go crazy y&#146;know, blow off some steam. 
  Ross:  Sure. Sure. Look I don&#146;t, I don&#146;t know if your plans are
finalized yet, but umm, hey I-I know another great way to blow off steam. 
  Elizabeth:  What? 
  Ross:  Are you into crafts at all? 
  Elizabeth:  Ross, are you okay? 
  Ross:  Well, yeah, of-of course I&#146;m okay! What? I&#146;m just being
supportive. Supportive of you and this whole trip, and-and (notices something) what-what
is uh, what&#146;s this? (He holds up a rather skimpy bathing suit.) 
  Elizabeth:  It&#146;s a bathing suit? 
  Ross:  To wear in front of people? 
  Elizabeth:  Is that supportive? 
  Ross:  Is this?! 
 [Scene: Central Perk, Rachel is reading as Monica and Chandler enter.] 
  Monica:  Hey! 
  Chandler:  Good-good-good-good. 
  Monica:  Hey! 
  Chandler:  Hey! 
  Rachel:  Hi! 
  Monica:  We&#146;re really glad you decided to meet our guy. 
  Rachel:  Oh&#133; 
  Monica:  You&#146;re gonna like him so much. So umm, when do you want to meet
him? 
  Rachel:  I don&#146;t know. I know I don&#146;t work late tomorrow night. 
  Chandler:  Tomorrow night is good. Tomorrow night is good, but uh, y&#146;know
what? Why put off something till tomorrow that you can do right now? (Laughs) Eldad come
here! (He stands up from the next table.) 
  Rachel:  What? 
  Monica:  Eldad, this is Rachel. 
  Eldad:  How are you? 
  Rachel:  Well-well a little blind sided but y&#146;know good. 
  Chandler:  Eldad, sit down. (To Rachel) Move over! Move over now! 
  Rachel:  I&#151;Ohh! (Moves over and lets Eldad sit on the couch.) 
  Chandler:  There you go! There you are! (Rachel stares at Monica and Chandler) 
  Monica:  Okay! Okay! We can take a hint! (They start to leave but run into Phoebe
with her guy in tow.) (To Phoebe) What are you doing here?! 
  Phoebe:  This is Patrick. (Points to him.) 
  Patrick:  Hi. 
  Chandler:  Hi. (To Phoebe) Okay, you&#146;re too late okay? Because she&#146;s
already with our guy. 
  Phoebe:  (looks) Oh my God, you&#146;re right! I am too late; they&#146;re
sitting on the couch and talking! (To Patrick) Come on! (They go over to the couch.)
Rachel? 
  Rachel:  Yeah? 
  Phoebe:  This is Patrick. 
  Rachel:  Oh, hi. 
  Patrick:  Hi. 
  Phoebe:  Yeah, this is the guy I was telling you about.  
  Rachel:  Yeah? 
  Phoebe:  Yeah. And believe me, this suit does not do justice to what&#146;s
underneath it. 
  Rachel:  Oh-okay, but Pheebs? 
  Phoebe:  Yeah? 
  Rachel:  I&#146;m just sort of in the middle of something. 
  Phoebe:  Oh! Okay! Yeah, that&#146;s okay. (To Patrick) Have a seat. (Sits
Patrick down next to Rachel.) 
  Monica:  No! You can&#146;t do that! 
  Eldad:  Maybe I should go! 
  Monica:  (stopping him) Sit down! We&#146;re winning! 
  Rachel:  Okay, y&#146;know what? Maybe I should go! 
  All:  (Chandler stops her) No-no-no-no! Have a seat! Have a seat! 
  Monica:  Rachel! Rachel! You haven&#146;t touched Eldad&#146;s hair! 
  Chandler:  It is the softest hair! Touch it! (Both he and Monica do so.) 
  Rachel:  Yeah, I&#146;m good. 
  Phoebe:  Rachel? Patrick is really rich. (To Patrick) Give her some money. 
  Patrick:  Y&#146;know what Phoebe? This isn&#146;t really worth the free massage. 
  Monica:  That&#146;s right Patrick, bye-bye! 
  Chandler:  (To Rachel) Eldad is much more cooperative! And he can dance! (To
Eldad) You dance for Rachel! 
 (He starts to get up, but Rachel stops him.) 
  Rachel:  No-no! Don&#146;t dance for me! Please? Don&#146;t! (She gets up to yell
at her &#145;friends.&#146;) What is the matter with you guys? 
  Phoebe:  Yeah, okay, let&#146;s talk it out. 
  Rachel:  I&#133; Am I the only one that this is embarrassing for? 
  Eldad:  I&#146;m a little embarrassed. (Chandler shushes him.) 
  Rachel:  I&#146;ll tell ya who should be embarrassed! It&#146;s you guys! Come
on! This is ridiculous! Thank you very much, but I do not need you to get me a date! 
  Phoebe:  Then why did she ask us to&#133; 
  Rachel:  I am still talking!! And then you chase away the one guy that I actually
liked! I mean, no offense to you guys. Really! I mean (To Patrick) congratulations on all
the cash, (He nods) and-and y&#146;know&#151;(Feels Eldad&#146;s hair)&#151;Wow! You do
have very soft hair! But I would much rather go to the ball all by myself than go through
anymore of this! Good-bye! (Grabs her stuff, starts to leave, then turns back suddenly,
and to Eldad) Now do you use some sort of special conditioner on that hair?! 
  Eldad:  Yes, Papaya Extract. 
  Rachel:  Thank you! (Storms out.) 
 [Scene: The airport, Elizabeth&#146;s flight is about to leave and Ross is there to
send her off.] 
  Ross:  So uh, have a great time down there. 
  Elizabeth:  I will. 
  Ross:  Yeah. And did you, did you pack that bathing suit? 
  Elizabeth:  Yeah. 
  Ross:  It was pretty funny when I, when I hid it for a while, huh? Anyway, umm,
I-I am worried about that bathing suit, not because it&#146;s revealing which I&#146;m
fine with, no I&#146;m concerned about your health, sun exposure. 
  Elizabeth:  Oh, don&#146;t worry I have plenty of sun block, it&#146;s SPF-30. 
  Ross:  Well, if what&#146;s in the bottle is actually 30. I mean sometimes you
get 30, sometimes it&#146;s-it&#146;s get 4, and I swear to God more often than not
it&#146;s just milk. 
  Elizabeth:  Ross, it&#146;s going to be okay. I&#146;m not going down there to
hook up with a bunch of guys. I really like you. I like how things are going between us. 
  Ross:  Really? 
  Elizabeth:  Yeah! I&#146;m just going down there to relax and hang out with my
friends. 
  Ross:  Okay. Cool. 
  Elizabeth:  Oh hey! Here they are! 
 (A group of about 10 guys and no women come running around the corner.) 
  Guy:  Elizabeth! 
 (The guys pick up Elizabeth and carry her onto the plane as she waves bye.) 
  Ross:  Call me! 
  Ending Credits

  Phoebe:  Rachel, we&#146;re sorry for pushing those guys on you. 
  Rachel:  Oh that&#146;s all right! Y&#146;know, I ended up having a really good
time. Y&#146;know, the charity was a big success and they raised a lot of money and
awareness. 
  Chandler:  So what was it for anyway? 
  Rachel:  I wanna say a disease. 
  Joey:  (entering) Hey! 
  All:  Hey! 
  Joey:  I just got this really weird message from Ross. He said turn on  MTV . 
  Rachel:  Huh. All right. 
 (Rachel does so and it&#146;s one of those dance party shows they have during spring
break and we see&#133;) 
  Phoebe:  Oh my God, look! That&#146;s Elizabeth! 
 (Suddenly Ross jumps in and starts dancing with her.) 
  Rachel:  Oh-oh Professor Geller.
