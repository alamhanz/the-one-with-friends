 [Scene: Monica, Chandler, and Phoebe's, everyone is there and they are finishing
watching the first episode of Mac and C.H.E.E.S.E. Joey is of course Mac.] 
  Mac:  (on TV) Well, if we learned one thing today C.H.E.E.S.E. is that
cheerleaders and high explosives don&#146;t mix. (Cut to Joey laughing while Rachel,
Chandler, and Monica aren&#146;t amused.) 
  C.H.E.E.S.E:  You can say that again Mac. 
  Mac:  Well, I couldn&#146;t have done it without you buddy. You&#146;re a genius. 
  C.H.E.E.S.E:  Oh yeah? Well then how come I can&#146;t get my VCR to stop
blinking 12:00? 
 (They both break into a huge laugh and do that stop motion thing they had at the end of
 ChiPs .) 
  Joey:  (laughing and turning off the TV) So, what did you guys think? 
 (They all make happy faces as they are unable to express their feelings verbally.
Finally, the phone rings and the race to answer it is won by Monica.) 
  Monica:  (on phone) Hello? (Listens) Hold on please. Joey, it&#146;s your mom.
(Hands him the phone.) 
  Chandler:  It&#146;s your mommy. It&#146;s your mommy. 
  Ross:  Ohhhh&#133; 
  Rachel:  That&#146;s nice. 
  Joey:  (on phone) Mom, so what did you think? (He walks away allowing the gang a
chance to figure out what they&#146;re gonna say.) 
  Rachel:  Well that was umm&#133;Okay. 
  Ross:  It wasn&#146;t the best. 
  Chandler:  That was one of the worse things ever. And not just on TV. 
  Monica:  Wh-what are we gonna tell him? 
  Ross:  Well, the lighting was okay. 
  Rachel:  Ohh no you don&#146;t! You got lighting last time, lighting is mine! 
  Monica:  And I have costumes. 
  Ross:  Oh great! That means I&#146;m stuck with, So, we were watching you
in there (Points to the TV) and you were sittin&#146; right here! Whoa! 
 (Phoebe gets up.) 
  Rachel:  What are you gonna do Pheebs? 
  Phoebe:  I don&#146;t know. I don&#146;t know. I can&#146;t lie to him again. Oh
no I&#151;no! I&#146;m just gonna press my breasts up against him. 
  Chandler:  And say nothing? 
  Phoebe:  Uh-huh, yeah that&#146;s right. 
  Joey:  (hangs up the phone) Wow! Well, my folks really liked it! So what-what did
you guys think? (Phoebe smiles, walks up to him, and presses her breasts against him.) It
wasn&#146;t  that  good.

  Rachel:  Yeah! Guess who walks into my office is the end of my story. (To Monica
and Phoebe) It was Ralph Lauren! (Monica and Phoebe gasp) Ralph Lauren walked into my
office! 
  Joey:  Uh Rach, if you&#146;re gonna start another story, at least let me finish
mine. 
  Rachel:  It&#146;s the same story. 
  Joey:  (groans in disgust) Wow, it&#146;s really long. 
  Rachel:  (ignoring him) Anyway, Ralph just came in to tell me that he&#146;s so
happy with my work that he wants me to be the new merchandising manager for polo retail.

  Rachel:  I get to hire my own assistant! 
 
 Monica and  Phoebe:   Ahhh!! 
  Joey:  (jumps up) Well&#151;I got a head rush from standing up to fast right
there. 
 [Scene: Rachel&#146;s New Office, she&#146;s interviewing a potential new assistant,
Hilda.] 
  Rachel:  (reading the resume) And you were at this job for four years? 
  Hilda:  That&#146;s right. 
  Rachel:  Okay, well this is all very impressive Hilda, um I just have one last
question for you. Uh, how did I do? Was this okay? 
  Hilda:  What? 
  Rachel:  I&#146;ve never interviewed anyone before. I&#146;ve actually never had
anyone  work  for me before. Although when I was a kid, we did have a maid, but this
is-this isn&#146;t the same thing.  
  Hilda:  No dear. It&#146;s not. 
  Rachel:  No. Yeah, and I know that. All right, well thank you so much for coming
in it was nice to meet you. 
  Hilda:  Thank you! Good meeting you. 
  Rachel:  All right. (Hilda exits) I&#146;m a total pro! 
 (There&#146;s a knock on the door and a handsome man enters.) 
  Man:  Hello? 
  Rachel:  (seeing him) Wow! H-umm! Hi! Yes, uh I&#146;m sorry the models are
actually down the hall. 
  Man:  Actually, I&#146;m here about the assistant job. 
  Rachel:  Really?! (Taking his resume) Okay well then, all right, well just have a
seat there. Umm, so what&#146;s&#151;what is&#151;what&#146;s your name? 
  Man:  Tag Jones. 
  Rachel:  Uh-huh, go on. 
  Tag:  That&#146;s it. That&#146;s my whole name. 
  Rachel:  That&#146;s your whole name, okay of course it is! Okay, well
let&#146;s-let&#146;s just have a look-see here. (Looking at his resume) 
  Tag:  I know I haven&#146;t worked in an office before, and I really don&#146;t
have a lot of experience, but uh&#133; 
  Rachel:  Oh come on, what are you talking about? You&#146;ve got three years
painting houses. Two  whole  summers at  T.G.I. Friday&#146;s , come on! 
  Tag:  It&#146;s lame, I know. But I&#146;m a goal-oriented person, very eager to
learn&#133; 
  Rachel:  Okay, hold on just a second. (She grabs a camera out of the desk and
takes his picture.) I&#146;m sorry, it&#146;s for human resources, everybody has to do it.
Could you just stand up please? 
 [Scene: Central Perk, Chandler is sitting on the couch when some unknown guy comes in
and sits in their easy chair.] 
  Chandler:  No-no-no-no. (Waves him away as Monica and Phoebe enter whispering to
each other.) Hey! (Monica shushes him.) 
  Phoebe:  (To Monica) Anyway, I should go. Okay, bye. 
  Monica:  (To Chandler) Hey sweetie. 
  Chandler:  Hi sweetie. So, what was with all the whispering? 
  Monica:  I can&#146;t tell you. It&#146;s a secret. 
  Chandler:  Secret? Married people aren&#146;t supposed to have secrets between
one another. We have too much love and respect for one another. 
  Monica:  Awww. (Kisses him.) But still no. 
  Chandler:  No I&#146;m serious, we should tell each other  every thing. I do
not have any secrets from you. 
  Monica:  Really? Okay, so why don&#146;t you tell me what happened to Ross Junior
year at  Disneyland ? 
  Chandler:  Oh no-no, I can&#146;t do that. 
  Monica:  If you tell me, I&#146;ll tell you what Phoebe said. 
  Chandler:  Okay. 
  Monica:  Okay. 
  Chandler:  So, Ross and I are going to  Disneyland  and we stop at this
restaurant for tacos. And when I say restaurant, I mean a guy, a hibachi, and the trunk of
his car. So Ross has about 10 tacos. And anyway, we&#146;re on  Space Mountain  and
Ross starts to feel a little iffy. 
  Monica:  Oh my God. He threw up? 
  Chandler:  No, he visited a little town south of throw up. (Monica laughs
hysterically.) So what was Phoebe&#146;s secret? 
  Monica:  Oh, Nancy Thompson from Phoebe&#146;s old massage place is getting
fired. 
  Chandler:  That&#146;s it?! I gave up my  Disneyland  story for that? 
  Monica:  That&#146;s right! You lose sucker!! (Pause) Please still marry me. 
 [Scene: Monica, Chandler, and Phoebe's, Chandler, Rachel, and Phoebe are there.] 
  Rachel:  Chandler, you have an assistant right? 
  Chandler:  (angrily) Did she call? You-you told her I was sick right? Always tell
her I am sick! 
  Rachel:  No, I-I just don&#146;t know how you decide who to hire. I mean
I&#146;ve got it narrowed down to two people. One of them has great references and a lot
of experience and then there&#146;s this guy&#133; 
  Chandler:  What about him? 
  Rachel:  I love him. He&#146;s so pretty I wanna cry! I don&#146;t know what to
do. Tell me what to do. 
  Phoebe:  Come on you know what to do! You hire the first one! You don&#146;t hire
an assistant because they&#146;re cute, you hire them because they&#146;re qualified. 
  Rachel:  Uh-huh. No, I hear what you&#146;re saying and-and-and that makes a lot
of sense but can I just say one more thing? (Takes out his picture.) Look how pretty! 
  Phoebe:  Let&#146;s see. (Looking at the picture) Oh my God! Oh&#133; But no! No!
You can&#146;t-you can&#146;t hire him, because that&#151;it&#146;s not professional. Umm,
this is for me (The picture) yes? Thanks. (Puts it in her pocket.) 
  Rachel:  Okay you&#146;re right. I&#146;ll hire Hilda tomorrow. Dumb old perfect
for the job Hilda! 
  Chandler:  Let me see this guy. (Phoebe hands him the picture.) W-H-Wow!
Don&#146;t show this to Monica! And don&#146;t tell her about the W-H-Wow! 
 [Scene: The  Days of Our Lives  producer&#146;s office, Joey is entering to find
Terry there.] 
  Terry:  Hey-hey-hey Joey! 
  Joey:  Hey Terry! 
  Terry:  Good to see you again! 
  Joey:  It&#146;s been a while, huh? Wow, it&#146;s funny these halls look smaller
then they used to. 
  Terry:  It&#146;s a different building. 
  Joey:  So! Stryker Remoray huh? When do you want me to start? 
  Terry:  Why don&#146;t we start right now! 
  Joey:  Okay. 
  Terry:  Here are the audition scenes. (Holds out the script.) 
  Joey:  (looking between the pages and him) Audition? I thought you were gonna
offer me the part. 
  Terry:  Why would you think that? 
  Joey:  Well, I was Dr. Drake Remoray, Stryker&#146;s twin brother. I mean, who
looks more me than me right? 
  Terry:  Everybody has to audition. 
  Joey:  Y&#146;know Terry, I-I don&#146;t really  need  to do this. I got my
own cable TV series, (Pause) with a robot. 
  Terry:  I&#146;m sorry Joey that&#146;s&#133;that&#146;s the way it is. 
  Joey:  Well. I guess you think you&#146;re pretty special huh? Sittin&#146; up
here in your fancy small hall building. Makin&#146; stars jump through hoops for ya, huh?
Well y&#146;know what? (Throws the script away) This is one star who&#146;s hoop&#133;
This is a star that the hoop&#151;this hoop&#151; I  was Dr. Drake Remoray! 
 [Scene: Rachel&#146;s office, she&#146;s there as Tag knocks on the door and enters
carrying a plant.] 
  Rachel:  Hi! Tag. What are you doing here? 
  Tag:  I just wanted to come by and thank you for not laughing in my face
yesterday. And I noticed there aren&#146;t any plants in your office so I wanted to bring
you your first&#133; (Notices her plant) There  is  a plant in your office. 
  Rachel:  Kinda. 
  Tag:  Right. So I guess I shouldn&#146;t put good at noticing stuff on my resume.
(Sets the plant down on her desk.) 
  Rachel:  Oh-ohh, thank you. 
  Tag:  Anyway, I&#146;m guessing you hired somebody. 
  Rachel:  Well&#133; 
  Tag:  Gotcha. Thanks again for meeting with me. (Starts to leave.) 
  Rachel:  But I hired you! 
  Tag:  What? 
  Rachel:  Yeah! You-you got the job! You&#146;re my new assistant! 
  Tag:  I am?! 
  Rachel:  Yeah! 
  Tag:  I can&#146;t believe it! 
  Rachel:  Me either. Umm, all right, first thing I need you to do is go downstairs
and find a women named Hilda and tell her to go home. 
 [Scene: Monica, Chandler, and Phoebe's, Monica is setting the table for dinner as
Chandler enters.] 
  Chandler:  Hey. 
  Monica:  Hey! Good, you&#146;re home! 
  Chandler:  Oh it&#146;s always nicer to here than, Aw crap! You
again! 
  Monica:  Hey baby. (Kisses him.) 
  Chandler:  Hey. 
  Monica:  I made you a surprise. 
  Chandler:  Oh yeah? 
  Monica:  Yeah, tacos! Ever since you told me that story I&#146;ve had such a
craving for them. 
  Chandler:  Did you not understand the story? 
  Ross:  (entering) Hey! 
  Chandler:  Hey! What&#146;s up? 
  Monica:  Ross! 
  Ross:  Oh, nothin&#146; much. Just trying to figure out what I&#146;m gonna do
for dinner. 
  Chandler:  Huh. 
  Ross:  (notices the table) Hey&#151;Ooh! What&#146;s-what&#146;s that, dinner
stuff? You making dinner? 
  Chandler:  No! (The oven dings.) Shhh! 
  Ross:  What you got over there? Tacos? 
  Monica:  No! No. They&#146;re umm&#133; They&#146;re just uh&#133;ground beef
smileys. (Holding up one of the shells.) 
  Ross:  Uhh, those are tacos. 
  Monica:  Excuse me Mr. Mexico. 
  Ross:  Eh, either way I&#146;ll pass. (Quietly to Chandler) I still can&#146;t
eat those. (Monica is getting something out of the fridge and starts laughing.)
What&#146;s so funny?! 
  Monica:  (trying not to laugh) I&#146;m not laughing.  
 (Ross and Chandler move closer to her and she starts laughing again.) 
  Ross:  (To Chandler) You told her! 
  Chandler:  Nancy Thompson&#146;s getting fired! (Monica slaps him on the
shoulder.) 
  Ross:  (To Monica) Look, okay-okay I had food poisoning! It&#146;s not like I
choose to do it! It&#146;s not like&#151;It&#146;s not like I said, Umm, what would
make  this  ride more fun?! 
  Monica:  You&#146;re right. I mean I&#146;m sorry. Yeah, I shouldn&#146;t be
laughing. I should be laying down papers for you! (Runs off laughing which gets Chandler
laughing.) 
  Ross:  (To Chandler) How could you tell her?! 
  Chandler:  I had too okay?! We&#146;re getting married! Married couples
can&#146;t keep secrets from one another! 
  Ross:  Oh really? Well I-I guess Monica should know about Atlantic City. 
  Chandler:  Du-ude! 
  Monica:  (running up to Ross) What happened in Atlantic City?! 
  Ross:  Well, Chandler and I are in a bar&#133; 
  Chandler:  Did you not hear me say, Du-ude?! 
  Ross:  And this girl is making eyes at Chandler, okay? So after awhile he-he goes
over to her and uh, after a minute or two, I see them kissing. Now, I know what
you&#146;re thinking, Chandler&#146;s not the type of guy who just goes to bars and makes
out with girls, and you&#146;re right, Chandler&#146;s not the type of guy who just goes
to bars and makes out with&#133;girls. 
  Monica:  (To Chandler) You kissed a guy?!! Oh my God. 
  Chandler:  In my defense, it was dark and he was a very pretty guy. 
  Ross:  Oh Mon, I laughed so hard&#133; 
  Chandler:  Ho-ho, so hard we had to throw out your underwear again? 
  Ross:  Whatever dude, you kissed a guy.

  Rachel:  Hi! 
  Joey:  Hey. 
  Phoebe:  Hey&#151;Ooh, how&#146;s Hilda? Is she working out? 
  Rachel:  Ohh, my new assistant is working out, yes. 
  Joey:  Was she happy you gave her the job? 
  Rachel:  Oh, my-my new assistant has very happy that I hired my new assistant. 
 (The phone rings and Joey answers it.) 
  Joey:  (on phone) Hello? (Listens) Oh hey! Can you, can you hang on a second? (To
Phoebe and Rachel) It&#146;s the producers over at Mac and C.H.E.E.S.E. can you excuse me
for a minute? (On phone) Hey, funny you should call. I was just looking over next
week&#146;s script. (Listens) Canceled?! (Listens) Like they&#146;re taking it off the

shootin&#146; them anymore?!! (Listens) All right, bye! (Hangs up) They canceled Mac and
C.H.E.E.S.E! 
  Phoebe:  Sorry. 
  Rachel:  I&#146;m sorry Joey. 
  Joey:  Why would they do that?! It was a good show right?! 
 (Phoebe and Rachel both pause, look at each other, and go press their breasts against
him. Which Joey doesn&#146;t mind, of course.) 
 [Scene: Monica, Chandler, and Phoebe's, Chandler, Monica, and Ross are still giving
away all of their secrets.] 
  Chandler:  You wanna tell secrets?! Okay! Okay! In college, Ross used to wear leg
warmers! 
  Ross:  All right! All right! Chandler entered a Vanilla Ice look-a-like contest
and won! 
  Chandler:  Ross came in forth and cried! 
  Monica:  Oh my God! (Laughing) 
  Ross:  Oh, is that funny?! Oh, you-you find that funny?! Well maybe Chandler
should know some of your secrets too! 
  Monica:  I-I already told him everything! (Threateningly) You shush!! 
  Ross:  Once Monica was sent to her room without dinner, so she ate the macaroni
off a jewelry box she&#146;d made. 
  Monica:  Ross used to stay up  every  Saturday night to watch  Golden
Girls ! 
  Ross:  Monica couldn&#146;t tell time &#145;til she was 13! 
  Monica:  It&#146;s hard for some people! 
  Chandler:  (To Monica) Of course it is. (Mouths to Ross) Wow&#151;whoa! 
  Monica:  Chandler one time wore my underwear to work! 
  Chandler:  Hey!!! 
  Monica:  Ohh, I&#146;m sorry I couldn&#146;t think of anymore for Ross! 
  Ross:  Ohh! Ohh! In college, Chandler got drunk and slept with the lady who
cleaned our dorm! 
  Chandler:  That was you! 
  Ross:  Whatever dude, you kissed a guy. 
 [Scene: Joey and Rachel's, Joey is still bumming about cancellation of Mac and
C.H.E.E.S.E.] 
  Joey:  How could this happen to me?! Yesterday I had  two  TV shows! Today,
I got nothin&#146;! 
  Rachel:  Well wait a minute, what happened to  Days of Our Lives ? 
  Joey:  Uh, well they might be a little mad at me over there. 
  Phoebe:  What happened? 
  Joey:  Well maybe I got a little upset and maybe I told them where they could go. 
  Rachel:  Joey, why would you do that? 
  Joey:  Because they wanted me to audition! 
  Phoebe:  You! An actor?! That&#146;s  mad ness! 
 [Scene: Rachel&#146;s Outer Office, Tag is sitting at his desk as Rachel walks up. She
stops and watches him pick up the phone.] 
  Tag:  Rachel Green&#146;s office. (Hangs up.) 
  Rachel:  Tag? (He turns and looks at her.) Hi, who was that? 
  Tag:  (shyly) Nobody. I was just practicing. 
  Rachel:  Really? (Giggles.) 
 (Phoebe rounds the corner.) 
  Phoebe:  Hi! 
  Tag:  Hi! Rachel Green&#146;s office. 
  Phoebe:  You must be Hilda. 
  Rachel:  Yeah, this is Tag. Tag, this is Phoebe. Phoebe, can I see you for a
second? (Goes into office.) 
  Tag:  Phoebe! That&#146;s a great name. 
  Phoebe:  Oh, you like that? You should hear my phone number. 
  Rachel:  (grabbing Phoebe) Okay. We&#146;ll be right back. (They go into her
office and she closes the door.) 
  Phoebe:  So you hired yourself a little treat did ya? 
  Rachel:  All right I know, I know how it looks Pheebs, but I&#146;m telling
you&#133; 
  Phoebe:  But-but you know you cannot get involved with your assistant. 
  Rachel:  Yes, I know that. I know that. And I know that hiring him was probably
not the smartest thing that I&#146;ve ever done. But I&#146;m telling you, from this
moment on I swear this is strictly professional. (There&#146;s a knock on the door.) Yes?  
 (Kathy enters (Because she&#146;s listed in the credits).) 
  Kathy:  Hey Rachel! 
  Rachel:  Hi!

  Terry:  Joey Tribbiani! I&#146;m surprised your big head could fit through our
small halls! (Gets up) I gotta go Joey. 
  Joey:  Wait! Terry! Wait&#151;Look&#151;Wait I-I&#133; Look, I&#146;m really
sorry about before. I was an idiot thinking I&#146;m too big to audition for you. You
gotta give me another chance. 
  Terry:  I can&#146;t help you Joey. 
  Joey:  Wait! Terry! Please! Look, I just lost my other job. Okay? You have no
idea how much I need this. Please, help me out, for old times sake. 
 [Cut to a hospital room set on the  Days of Our Lives  stage. Two nurses are
standing next to a bed with a man whose face is completely covered in bandages and reading
his chart.] 
  Nurse #1:  This poor guy&#146;s been in a coma for five years. It&#146;s
hopeless. 
  Nurse #2:  It&#146;s not hopeless! Dr. Stryker Remoray&#146;s a miracle worker.
Look, here he comes. 
 (Stryker enters, only it&#146;s not Joey playing him.) 
  Dr. Stryker Remoray:  Good morning. (He walks over to the bed, leans down, and
whispers to him.) Drake, it&#146;s your brother Stryker. Can you hear me? 
 
 The Director:  And cut! 
  Joey:  (jumping up and removing the bandages) I&#146;m back baby! Ha-ha-ha! 
 [Scene: Central Perk, Chandler, Monica, and Ross are sitting there and not talking to
each other.] 
  Monica:  Y&#146;know, in my defense, umm there was no glitter on the macaroni and
 very  little glue. 
  Ross:  And in  my  defense, the cleaning lady came on to me! 
  Chandler:  (To Monica) You have no trouble telling time now right? 
  Monica:  No! 
  Chandler:  Quick! What time is it?! (Holds his watch in front of her face.) 
  Monica:  I don&#146;t know! Time to kiss a guy maybe?! (Ross laughs.) What are
you laughing at  Pampers ? (He stops laughing and glares at her.) 
  Chandler:  Y&#146;know when I said that because we&#146;re getting married that
we should share everything and not have any secrets?  
  Monica:  Yeah? 
  Chandler:  Yeah that was stupid. Let&#146;s not do that. 
  Monica:  Ohh, absolutely. 
  Ross:  And! We should keep all the stuff uh, we told each other secret from
everybody else. 
  Monica:  Yeah, definitely! 
  Ross:  Okay, (gets up) if you&#146;ll excuse me, I-I&#146;m gonna go hang out
with some people who don&#146;t know the  Space Mountain  story. 
  Monica:  Then, I&#146;d steer clear of Phoebe. 
  Ross:  Man! (Monica mouths, I&#146;m sorry.) 
  Chandler:  Yeah, and not that you would, but I wouldn&#146;t hang out
with&#133;all the guys in my office. 
 (Ross storms out.) 
  Ending Credits  
 [Scene: Rachel&#146;s office, she&#146;s looking at a picture of Tag when he knocks and
enters.] 
  Rachel:  (noticing him) Hi! (Puts the pictures away.) 
  Tag:  Do you have a minute? 
  Rachel:  Well yeah, sure, what&#146;s up? 
  Tag:  I got asked out twice today when I was at lunch&#133;by guys. 
  Rachel:  Oh really?! 
  Tag:  Yeah. Did you tell someone that I was gay? 
  Rachel:  Oh, did you not want people to know that? 
  Tag:  But I&#146;m not gay. And I especially wouldn&#146;t want you to think I
was gay.

  Tag:  Okay. 
  Rachel:  &#145;Kay. 
  Tag:  Well&#133; 
  Rachel:  Yeah. 
  Tag:  I&#146;d love to ask out your friend Phoebe.
