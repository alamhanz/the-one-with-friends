 [Scene: Central Perk, everyone is there except Monica as Ross enters carrying a huge
stack of newspapers.] 
  Ross:  Hey you guys I got some bad news. (He sets the stack of papers down on the
table.) 
  Phoebe:  Well that&#146;s no way to sell newspapers. Why don&#146;t you try,
Extra! Extra! Read all about it! 
  Ross:  No, Monica&#146;s restaurant got a horrible review in the Post. (They all
gasp.) I didn&#146;t want her to see it, so I ran around the neighborhood and bought all
the copies I could find. (He hands the paper to Phoebe and they all read it.) 
  Joey:  Man, this is bad! And I&#146;ve had my share of bad reviews. I still
remember my first good one though. (Quoting) Everything else in this production of  Our
Town  was simply terrible. Joey Tribbiani was abysmal. 
  Monica:  (entering) Hey! 
  Chandler:  Hey. 
  Monica:  (seeing the stack of newspapers) Oh my God! Look at all the newspapers!
It must be a good review! Is it great?! 
  Ross:  Umm&#133; 
  Monica:  (reading) Oh dear God! 
  Ross:  But the good news is, no one in a two-block radius will ever know. 
  Monica:  What about the rest of Manhattan?! 
  Ross:  Yeah, they all know. 
  Monica:  Oh my God, this is horrible! 
  Chandler:  I&#146;m so sorry. 
  Monica:  I&#146;m so humiliated! 
  Rachel:  Yeah but y&#146;know what they say Mon, There&#146;s no such thing
as bad press. 
  Monica:  You don&#146;t think that umm, (reading) The chef&#146;s Mahi Mahi
was awful awful, is bad press? 
  Rachel:  I didn&#146;t write it. 
  Monica:  Is he right? Am I really&#151;Am I awful? 
  All:  No! 
  Joey:  Yeah! Yeah Monica! You listen to me, okay? And I&#146;m not just saying
this because I&#146;m your friend, I&#146;m sayin&#146; it &#145;cause it&#146;s the
truth. You&#146;re food is abysmal! 
  Opening Credits  
 [Scene: Ross and Rachel's, it&#146;s late at night, Rachel is sitting on the couch in
the dark wide-awake as Ross walks to the bathroom.] 
  Rachel:  Ross! 
  Ross:  (startling him) What?! What? 
  Rachel:  I am freaking out! 
  Ross:  Are ya? 
  Rachel:  My due date is in one week!  
  Ross:  What are you doing up? 
  Rachel:  That is seven days! 
  Ross:  Okay look, I had a lot of water before I went to bed. Can we do this
after&#133; 
  Rachel:  (interrupting him) No-no-no-no-no Ross! Please, come on we do not have
any of the big stuff we need! We do not a changing table! We do not have a crib! We do not
have a diaper service! 
  Ross:  It&#146;s funny you should mention diapers. 
  Rachel:  I&#146;m serious. 
  Ross:  Okay look, there&#146;s nothing to worry about. We have plenty of time.
There&#146;s a great baby furniture store on west 10 th . Tomorrow, we will go
there and we will get you everything that you need. Okay? 
  Rachel:  Okay. Thank you. That&#146;s great. Thank you. Wait-wait! Where on west
10 th ? Because there&#146;s this really cute shoe store that has like this
little&#133; 
  Ross:  (interrupting her) Okay. Okay. If uh, if you&#146;re gonna do this, then
I&#146;m gonna do that. (Points to the bathroom.) So&#133; (Starts for the bathroom.) 
  Rachel:  (stopping him) Oh, wait Ross! I&#146;m sorry, one more thing! 
  Ross:  (annoyed) Yeah! 
  Rachel:  Umm, our situation. Y&#146;know umm, what we mean to each other. And I
mean we-we&#146;re having this baby together, and we live together. Isn&#146;t that,
isn&#146;t that weird? 
  Ross:  (stunned) (thinks) Well uh&#133; 
  Rachel:  I&#146;m just kidding! You can go pee! (He does so in a hurry.) 
 [Scene: Monica and Chandler's, Monica is cooking as Chandler looks on. 
  Joey:  (entering) Hey uh Monica, I can&#146;t remember. Did we say we were gonna
meet here or at the movies? 
  Monica:  We said at the movies, but&#133; 
  Joey:  Okay, I&#146;ll see you there. (Starts to leave)  
  Monica:  Joey! (He returns) Now that you&#146;re here&#133; 
  Joey:  Sure, I can hang out &#145;til I have to meet ya. (To Chandler) What
uh&#151;How come you&#146;re not going? 
  Chandler:  I have a job interview I have to get ready for. 
  Joey:  I thought you already have a job. 
  Chandler:  And people say you don&#146;t pay attention. No, this is a much better
job. It&#146;s vice-president of a company that does data reconfiguration and statistical
factoring for other companies. 
  Joey:  Wow! How do you know how to do that?! 
  Chandler:  That&#146;s what I do now. 
  Monica:  Hey Joey, come taste this. 
  Joey:  What is it? 
  Monica:  Remember that guy that gave me a bad review? Well&#133; (Feeds him a
spoonful of what she&#146;s cooking.) I&#146;m getting my revenge! 
  Joey:  You cooked him? 
  Monica:  No. He teaches a course on food criticism at the New School, so before
we go to the movies I wanna go by there and make him try my bouillabaisse again. Oh, I
cannot wait to read the front page of the Post tomorrow! Restaurant reviewer admits:
I was wrong about Monica. 
  Chandler:  The front page? You really do live in your own little world,
don&#146;t ya? 
 [Scene: The Baby Furniture Store, Ross and Rachel are checking out.] 
  Cashier:  Do you uh, want these things delivered Mr. and Mrs. Geller? 
  Rachel:  Oh. 
  Ross:  Oh. 
  Rachel:  No-no-no! No, no, no, we&#146;re not married. 
  Ross:  We are having a baby together, but we&#146;re not involved. (The cashier,
a very beautiful woman, looks confused) I mean, uh we-we were seeing each other a while
ago, but then we were just friends. And then there was one drunken night. (Rachel looks at
him angrily) Or, yes stranger, we&#146;d like this delivered please. 
  Cashier:  Why don&#146;t you fill out this address card. (Hands him one.) 
  Ross:  Oh, okay. 
  Cashier:  I notice you picked out a lot of our dinosaur items. 
  Rachel:  Oh yeah! Actually, that&#146;s one of the reasons why we&#146;re not a
couple. 
  Ross:  I chose those, I&#146;m a paleontologist. 
  Cashier:  Really?! That is so cool! 
  Rachel:  Oh. Oh yeah, don&#146;t get to worked up over it. I mean it-it sounds
like he&#146;s a doctor, but he&#146;s not. 
  Cashier:  Oh no-no, I&#146;m fascinated by paleontology. Have you read the new
Walter Alvarez book? 
  Ross:  Yeah! I-I teach it in my class. 
  Rachel:  Oh my God! I&#146;m standing at a cash register, holding a credit card,
and I&#146;m bored. 
  Cashier:  (looking at the completed address card) Oh, I love your neighborhood.
There&#146;s a great gym right around the corner from your building. 
  Ross:  That&#146;s my gym. 
  Cashier:  I can tell you work out. (Ross is please and Rachel looks at him
confused.) A paleontologist who works out, you&#146;re like Indiana Jones. (Rachel has a
disbelieving look on her face.) 
  Ross:  I  am  like Indiana Jones. 
 [Scene: Central Perk, Phoebe is there as Rachel enters.] 
  Rachel:  Hi Pheebs! 
  Phoebe:  Hey! Oh, how did baby shopping go? 
  Rachel:  Oh, it was great! We got everything that we needed! Oh and Ross, almost
got something that wasn&#146;t on the list. A whore. 
  Phoebe:  What?! 
  Rachel:  Well, we were paying for our stuff and this saleswoman just started
flirting with him. 
  Phoebe:  Well did she know you two weren&#146;t married? 
  Rachel:  Yeah. 
  Phoebe:  Oh my God! Well the idea of a woman flirting with a-with a single man,
we-we must alert the church elders! 
  Rachel:  You don&#146;t understand! You didn&#146;t see how brazen she was. 
  Phoebe:  Sounds like you&#146;re a little jealous. 
  Rachel:  No! I&#146;m not! I-I-I just think it&#146;s wrong! It&#146;s-it&#146;s
that I&#146;m&#151;Here I am about to pop and he&#146;s out picking up some shop girl at
Sluts &#145;R&#146; Us! 
  Phoebe:  Is that a real place? (Rachel&#146;s stunned) Are they hiring? 
  Chandler:  (entering) Hey Phoebe! (To Rachel) Fatty! 
  Phoebe:  Hey Chandler, why so fancy? 
  Chandler:  Well, I got a job interview. It&#146;s kinda a big deal too. Its a lot
more money and I&#146;d be doing data reconfiguration and statistical factoring. 
  Phoebe:  Wait, I think I know someone who does that. 
  Chandler:  Me! I do that. So&#133; Seriously, do I look okay? I&#146;m little
nervous. 
  Rachel:  Oh yeah! You really&#151;You look great. 
  Phoebe:  Yeah, just don&#146;t get your hopes up. 
  Chandler:  Why not? 
  Phoebe:  Well, the interview&#133; 
  Chandler:  What about it? 
  Phoebe:  Y&#146;know! You don&#146;t make a very good first impression. 
  Chandler:  (shocked) What?! 
  Phoebe:  Oh you don&#146;t know. 
  Chandler:  Are you serious?! 
  Phoebe:  Yes, when I first met you, you were like, Blah, blah, blah.
I was like, shhh! 
  Chandler:  What is it that I do? 
  Phoebe:  Well it&#146;s just like you&#146;re trying too hard. Always making
jokes, y&#146;know, you just&#151;You come off a little needy. 
  Chandler:  (To Rachel) Did you like me when we first met? 
  Rachel:  Chandler, I&#146;m not gonna lie to ya, but I am gonna run away from
you. (Gets up and hurries out.) 
 [Scene: The New School, Monica, carrying her dish, and Joey are confronting the food
critic.] 
  Monica:  Hi! Umm, I&#146;m Monica Geller, I&#146;m the chef at Alessandro&#146;s. 
  The Food Critic:  Still? 
  Monica:  I think the things that you said about me are really unfair, and I would
like for you to give my bouillabaisse another chance. 
  The Food Critic:  I don&#146;t see any reason why I would do that to myself
again. 
  Joey:  Either eat it, or be in it. 
  Monica:  Spoon? (Hands him one and he tastes it.) So, what do you think? 
  The Food Critic:  I&#146;m torn, between my integrity and my desire to avoid a
beating. But I must be honest, your soap is abysmal. (Throws down the spoon and walks
out.) 
  Joey:  Thata girl! Huh? We should get out of here; there&#146;s a new class
comin&#146; in. 
 (They start to leave.) 
  The Cooking Teacher:  Welcome to introduction to cooking. Now, before we start,
can anyone tell me the difference between a hollandaise sauce and a bearnaise sauce? (No
one can.) 
  Monica:  I can. 
  The Cooking Teacher:  Okay, go ahead. 
  Monica:  Well umm, they both have a egg yolk and butter base, but a bearnaise has
shallots, shirvel, and most importantly tarragon.  
  The Cooking Teacher:  That&#146;s very good, what&#146;s your name? 
  Monica:  Monica. 
  The Cooking Teacher:  Monica, you go to the head of the class. 
  Monica:  Okay. (Does so.) 
 [Scene: Ross and Rachel's, Ross and Rachel are unpacking and setting up their new
purchases.] 
  Rachel:  All this stuff takes up a lot of room. Hey how uh, how serious are you
about keeping Ben in your life? 
  Ross:  My son? Pretty serious. (There&#146;s a knock on the door and Ross answers
it.) Oh hey Katie! (The cashier from before) What uh, what are you doing here? 
  Katie:  Well, the delivery went out to you and I realized they forgot this. (A
blanket.) 
  Ross:  Ah, must&#146;ve been fairly obvious since it was the only thing left in
your store. 
  Katie:  Listen, to be honest, home deliveries are really a part of my job
description. 
  Ross:  Oh. (Reaches into his pocket for some money as Rachel enters the living
room and watches holding two stuffed dinosaurs.) 
  Katie:  Oh uh&#133;I actually came here to ask you out. 
  Ross:  Oh! Wow! Uh, yeah! That sounds great. I&#146;m just gonna put this (The
money) back in my pocket, pretend  that  didn&#146;t happen. Uh yeah, actually
I&#146;m free now. Do you wanna grab some coffee or&#133; 
  Katie:  Sure! 
  Rachel:  Horny bitch. (They both look at her, pretending that the dinosaurs
she&#146;s holding are arguing.) No! You&#146;re a horny bitch! Noooo! You&#146;re the
horny bitch! No! You&#146;re a horny bitch! 
  Commercial Break  
 [Scene: Ross and Rachel's, continued from before.] 
  Rachel:  So you guys go, have a really good time. 
  Ross:  (To Katie) Yeah, I&#146;m just gonna grab my coat. And uh, and my whip.
(Katie looks worried.) Y&#146;know because of the Indiana Jones? (Katie laughs) Not-not
because I&#146;m-I&#146;m into SM. (Katie&#146;s worried again.) I&#146;m
not-I&#146;m not into anything weird. Y&#146;know? Just-just normal sex. (Katie is
uncomfortable.) So, I&#146;m gonna grab my coat. (Does so, leaving Katie and Rachel
alone.) 
  Rachel:  So, you had a good day huh? Big commission; picked up a daddy. 
  Katie:  Are you okay with this? 
  Rachel:  Oh yeah! Yeah please, you guys have fun. 
  Katie:  Okay. It was nice to see you. 
  Rachel:  Oh and it was great to see you too. And you look fantastic, although you
missed a button. 
  Katie:  Oh umm, actually I umm&#133; 
  Rachel:  Oh okay, I see what you&#146;re doing there. 
 [Scene: Monica and Chandler's, Chandler and Phoebe are entering.] 
  Chandler:  I can&#146;t even believe this! I really come off that badly? 
  Phoebe:  Oh! It&#146;s okay, you calm down after a while and then people can see
how really sweet and wonderful you really are. 
  Chandler:  Oh good. Good, because I&#146;m sure this interview is gonna last a
couple of weeks. 
  Phoebe:  All right, don&#146;t  freak  out! Okay? I-I will help you. How
long before you have to leave? 
  Chandler:  An hour. 
  Phoebe:  I can&#146;t help you. 
  Chandler:  Phoebe! 
  Phoebe:  All right, all right, we&#146;ll just do our best. Okay? So let&#146;s
say I&#146;m the interviewer and I&#146;m meeting you for the first time. Okay. Hi!
Come on in, I&#146;m uh, Regina Philange. 
  Chandler:  Chandler Bing. 
  Phoebe:  Bing, what an unusual name. 
  Chandler:  Well you should meet my uncle, Bada. (Pause) I&#146;ll let myself out. 
 [Scene: The Cooking Class, Joey is trying to cook as the teacher walks over to him.] 
  Joey:  Hi. 
  The Cooking Teacher:  Your Fettuccini Alfredo looks a little dry, did you use all
your cheese? 
  Joey:  When you say used, do you mean eat as a pre-cooking snack? 
  The Cooking Teacher:  And the cream? 
  Joey:  Cheese makes me thirsty. 
  The Cooking Teacher:  Okay. Let&#146;s move on. 
  Joey:  All right. 
  The Cooking Teacher:  (To Monica) Oh! Something smells good over at Monica&#146;s
station! (She tries Monica&#146;s fettuccini.) Oh my God! This is absolutely amazing!
You&#146;ve never made this before? 
  Monica:  Oh no! I don&#146;t know anything about cooking. I had to ask someone
what it&#146;s called when the, when the water makes those little bubbles. 
  The Cooking Teacher:  Well, hats off to the chef. 
  Monica:  I-I-I&#146;m sorry, your-your mouth was full, I didn&#146;t hear what
you said. Umm, hats off to who now? 
  The Cooking Teacher:  The chef! 
  Monica:  That&#146;s right. 
 [Scene: Monica and Chandler's, Chandler and Phoebe are still working on his
interviewing techniques.] 
  Chandler:  &#133;I think you&#146;ll find if I come to work here, I don&#146;t
micro-manage. I don&#146;t shy away from delegating. 
  Phoebe:  Um-hmm, that&#146;s good to know. But let&#146;s stop focusing on what
you don&#146;t do, and start focusing on what you do do. 
  Chandler:  (suppressing a smile) What I do do&#133;is manage to uh, create an
atmosphere of support for the people working with me. 
  Phoebe:  I see. Nice sidestep on the do do thing by the way. 
  Chandler:  Hardest thing I&#146;ve ever done in my life. 
  Phoebe:  You gotta go! 
  Chandler:  Oh! (Stands up.) 
  Phoebe:  Okay, don&#146;t worry. You&#146;re ready. 
  Chandler:  Really? 
  Phoebe:  Absolutely! Just fight all your natural instincts and you&#146;ll be
great. 
  Chandler:  Okay. 
 [Scene: The Cooking Class, everyone has finished baking a batch of cookies and the
teacher is going around tasting them.] 
  The Cooking Teacher:  Ah Monica, my star student. 
  Monica:  Y&#146;know, you called me that before so I-I took the liberty of
fashioning a star out of aluminum foil. Now, no pressure, you like my cookies, you give me
the star. (Hands it to her.) 
  The Cooking Teacher:  (tasting the cookie and with her mouthful) Oh, yum-yum-yum.
(Hands the star back.) 
  Monica:  Wow! A star! (The class glares at her.) I know you all hate me and-and
I&#146;m sorry, but I don&#146;t care. 
 (The teacher goes to Joey&#146;s station.) 
  The Cooking Teacher:  Okay Joey, you&#146;re up next. (Tries one of his cookies.)
This are good! This is amazing! You get an A! 
  Joey:  I can an A? In-in school? (To Joey) Hey, I&#146;m a dork. 
  Monica:  Joey! I&#146;m so proud of you! 
  The Cooking Teacher:  I think you should give him your star. 
  Monica:  Excuse me? He doesn&#146;t even know what he&#146;s doing! 
  The Cooking Teacher:  We&#146;re all beginners here. Nobody knows what
they&#146;re doing. 
  Monica:  I do! I&#146;m a professional chef! (The class gasps.) Oh relax!
It&#146;s not a courtroom drama! 
  The Cooking Teacher:  If you&#146;re a professional chef, what are you doing
taking Introduction to Cooking? 
  Joey:  Yeah! 
  Monica:  I&#146;m-I&#146;m sorry, it&#146;s just that umm&#133; Well I-I cook at
this restaurant, Alessandro&#146;s, and umm I just got a really bad review&#133; 
  The Cooking Teacher:  Oh Alessandro&#146;s! I  love  that place! 
  Monica:  You do? 
  The Cooking Teacher:  Oh yes! You&#146;re an excellent chef! As a person
you&#146;re a little&#133; 
  Monica:  Oh, I&#146;m totally crazy, but you-you like the food? 
  The Cooking Teacher:  Very much. 
  Monica:  Okay then, I don&#146;t stink. I&#146;m a good chef. Okay. (Starts to
leave.) 
  Joey:  Whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa! I don&#146;t want to go. I&#146;m having fun. 
  The Cooking Teacher:  Well actually, did either of you pay for this class? 
  Joey:  Hey-hey-hey, if my friend says it&#146;s time to go, it&#146;s time to go.
(Starts to leave, but comes back for his cookies.) 
 [Scene: An Office Building, Chandler is on his interview.] 
  Chandler:  &#133;also I was the point person on my company&#146;s transition from
the KL-5 to GR-6 system. 
  The Interviewer:  You must&#146;ve had your hands full. 
  Chandler:  That I did. That I did. 
  The Interviewer:  So let&#146;s talk a little bit about your duties. 
  Chandler:  (nervous) My duties? (Trying not to crack a joke) All right. 
  The Interviewer:  Now you&#146;ll be heading a whole division, so you&#146;ll
have a lot of duties. 
  Chandler:  (trying not to laugh) I see. 
  The Interviewer:  But there&#146;ll be perhaps 30 people under you so you can
dump a certain amount on them. 
  Chandler:  (really try not to laugh) Good to know. 
  The Interviewer:  We can go into detail&#133; 
  Chandler:  No don&#146;t I beg of you! 
  The Interviewer:  All right then, we&#146;ll have a definite answer for you on
Monday, but I think I can say with some confidence, you&#146;ll fit in well here. 
  Chandler:  (relieved) Really?! 
  The Interviewer:  Absolutely. (They walk to the door.) You can relax; you did
great. 
  Chandler:  Yeah I gotta say thank you, I was really nervous. Y&#146;know
I&#146;ve been told I come on to strong, make to many jokes, and then it was really hard
to sidestep that duty thing. (The interviewer doesn&#146;t understand) Duties. (Still
doesn&#146;t.) Duties! (Still doesn&#146;t.) Poo. (Still doesn&#146;t.) 
  The Interviewer:  Poo? 
  Chandler:  Oh my God this doesn&#146;t count! Okay? The interview was over, that
was the real Chandler Bing in there, this is just some crazy guy out in the hall! Call
security! There&#146;s a crazy guy out in the hall! 
  The Interviewer:  Poo?! 
  Chandler:  I&#146;ll look forward to your call. (Walks away.) 
 [Scene: Ross and Rachel's, Ross is returning from his date.] 
  Ross:  Hey. 
  Rachel:  Hi! You&#146;re back from your date! 
  Ross:  How are you? 
  Rachel:  I&#146;m fine, but that&#146;s not important. What&#146;s important is
how was she? 
  Ross:  Uhh, it was fun. We, we just had coffee. 
  Rachel:  Oh uh-huh, uh-huh, coffee, a little rub-rub-rub under the table. 
  Ross:  What&#146;s uh, what&#146;s going on? Do you not, do you not like Katie? 
  Rachel:  No! No, she&#146;s&#151;She was nice. I mean, she&#146;s a little
slutty, but who isn&#146;t? 
  Ross:  I liked her. 
  Rachel:  Of course you did Ross, you would date a gorilla if it called you
Indiana Jones! 
  Ross:  Did you get like a fresh batch of pregnancy hormones today?! 
  Rachel:  No! It&#146;s just that, Kate bothered me.  
  Ross:  Why? What was wrong with her? 
  Rachel:  There was nothing wrong with her! All right? She was perfectly lovely! 
  Ross:  Okay, so what&#146;s the matter? 
  Rachel:  I don&#146;t want you to date her! 
  Ross:  (laughs) Why? What, what are you jealous? 
  Rachel:  Yes! And not because I want you to go out with me, but because I
don&#146;t want you to go out with anybody! Okay? I know it&#146;s a terrible thing to
even think this, and it&#146;s completely inappropriate, but I want you to be at my
constant beck and call 24 hours a day! I&#146;m very sorry, but that is just the way that
I feel. 
  Ross:  Okay. 
  Rachel:  What?! 
  Ross:  I won&#146;t date. I&#146;ll uh, I&#146;ll be here, with you, all the
time. 
  Rachel:  Really? But I&#146;m being so unreasonable. 
  Ross:  True, but you&#146;re allowed to be unreasonable. You&#146;re having our
baby. 
 (Pause.) 
  Rachel:  (starting to cry) Oh Ross, thank you. Thank you. (They hug.) 
  Ross:  Do you feel better? 
  Rachel:  No, not really. You&#146;re pressing the baby into my bladder and now I
have to pee. Sorry. (She gets up and starts for the bathroom.) 
  Ross:  Uh Rach? 
  Rachel:  Yeah. (Stops and starts doing the I-have-to-go-to-the-bathroom dance.) 
  Ross:  Just one thing umm&#133; 
  Rachel:  Uh-huh. 
  Ross:  We live together. You&#146;re having our baby. I&#146;m not gonna see
anybody else. Are you-are you sure you don&#146;t want something more? 
  Rachel:  (pause) Wow! I don&#146;t know, maybe. I&#146;m&#133; 
  Ross:  Oh-oh, Rach! I was just messin&#146; around! (She&#146;s stunned) Like you
did last night when I had to pee? 
  Rachel:  (laughs) I knew that! I knew that! I was just messin&#146; with you too!
 
  Ross:  (pause) Okay. Okay. Because for a minute you said you&#133; 
  Rachel:  Oh no-no-no-no, no! 
  Ross:  &#133;that you actually&#133; 
  Rachel:  No that&#146;s just&#151;(Laughs)&#151;That&#146;s just &#145;cause
I&#146;m such a good messer! 
 (They both laugh. Ross sits down, but Rachel doesn&#146;t move and is lost in thought.) 
  Ross:  Rach? 
  Rachel:  Yeah? 
  Ross:  The bathroom? 
  Rachel:  Right! (Heads for the bathroom.) 
  Closing Credits  
 [Scene: The New School, Joey and Monica are walking down a hallway.] 
  Joey:  Well I had a great time! Learned how to bake, ate great food, that&#146;s
the first A I&#146;ve gotten since seventh grade,  and  I didn&#146;t have to sleep
with the teacher this time. 
  Monica:  Oh, look! Acting for Beginners! Want to feel good about yourself? 
  Joey:  What the hell! 
  Monica:  Okay. 
 (They enter.) 
  The Acting Teacher:  All right, let&#146;s start with some basics. Can anybody
tell me what the difference between upstage and downstage is? 
 (No one can and Monica looks at Joey expectantly.) 
  Joey:  Yeah, this was a stupid idea. (Exits.) 
  End
