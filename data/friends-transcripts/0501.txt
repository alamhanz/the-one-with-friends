 [Scene: Ross&#146;s Wedding, continued from last season, the Minister is about to marry
Ross and Emily.] 
  Minister:  Friends. Family. We are gathered to celebrate here today the joyous
union of Ross and Emily. (Time lapse) Now Ross, repeat after me. I Ross... 
  Ross:  I Ross... 
  Minister:  Take thee, Emily... 
  Ross:  Take thee, Rachel...(All his friends have looks of shock on their faces.
He realizes what he said. Quickly he says.) Emily. (A slight chuckle.) Emily. 
  Minister:  (Looking and feeling awkward. he looks towards Emily.) Uhh...Shall I
go on? 
  Rachel:  (To the woman sitting in front of her) He-he said Rachel, right? Do you
think I should go up there? 
  Emily:  Yes, yes, do go on. 
  Minister:  I think we&#146;d better start again. Ross, repeat after me. I,
Ross&#133; 
  Ross:  I, Ross&#133; 
  Minister:  Take thee,  EM-I-LY &#133; 
  Ross:  Take thee, (Glares at the Minister)  Emily . (Chuckles) Like
there&#146;d be anybody else. (Emily is glaring at him.) 
  Minister:  As my lawfully wedded wife, in sickness and in health, till death
parts us. 
  Ross:  As my lawfully wedded wife, in sickness and in health, until death parts
us. Really, I do. Emily. (Points at her.) 
  Minister:  May I have the rings? (He is given the rings) Emily, place this ring
on Ross&#146;s finger as a symbol of your bond everlasting. (She jams the ring onto his
finger) Ross, place this ring in Emily&#146;s hand as a symbol of the love that encircles
you forever. 
  Ross:  Happy too. 
  Minister:  Ross and Emily have made their declarations and it gives me great
pleasure to declare them husband and wife. 
  Ross:  Yay! 
  Minister:  You may kiss the bride. 
 (He goes to kiss her, but she isn&#146;t very receptive of the kiss. She keeps avoiding
him, until Ross finally gets to kiss her on her cheek.) 
  Mrs. Geller:  (To Mr. Geller) This is worse than when he married the lesbian. 
 (The band starts to play, and the recessional starts. Ross tries to take Emily&#146;s
hand, but she snatches it away from him.) 
  Emily:  Just keep smiling. 
  Ross:  Okay. 
  Joey:  Well, that went well. Yeah. 
  Chandler:  It could&#146;ve been worse, he could&#146;ve shot her. 
 (Ross and Emily make it to the lobby.) 
  Ross:  (laughs) That uh, that was pretty funny. Wasn&#146;t it? 
 (Emily gives him a forearm shot across the stomach.) 
  Opening Credits  
 [Scene: The Wedding reception, Ross and Emily are in the bathroom and Emily is yelling
at him. Rachel, Chandler, Joey, and Monica are standing outside the doorway.] 
  Emily:  (Yelling from inside the bathroom) You&#146;ve spoiled everything!
It&#146;s like a nightmare! My friends and family are out there! How can I face them?! How
can you do this to me?! 
  Joey:  (To the gang) Hey, no matter what happens with Ross and Emily, we still
get cake right? 
  Ross:  (exiting the bathroom) That-that-that&#146;s all right, no honey, you take
your time sweetie. I&#146;ll be right out here. (She slams the door in his face, to the
gang) She&#146;s just fixing her makeup. 
  Emily:  I hate you!! 
  Ross:  And, I love you!! (He walks into the living room) 
  Mr. Geller:  Boy, bad time to say the wrong name, huh Ross? 
  Ross:  That&#146;s true, thanks dad. (To All) People should be dancing! Huh? Hey,
this is a party! Come on! Joey, dance!! (He starts to dance but stops when no one else
joins him.) 
 (Mrs. Waltham&#146;s phone rings and she answers it.) 
  Mrs. Waltham:  Yes, Waltham interiors. 
  Phoebe:  (On the phone, in New York) Uh, hello, this is Ross Geller&#146;s
personal physician, Dr. Philange. 
  Mrs. Waltham:  Who? 
  Phoebe:  Yeah, I&#146;ve discovered that Ross forgot to take his brain medicine,
uh, now without it, uh, in the brain of Ross, uh women&#146;s names are interchangeable,
through-through no fault of his own. 
  Mrs. Waltham:  Oh my God, Phoebe. 
  Phoebe:  No, not Phoebe, Dr. Philange. Oh no! You have it too! 
 (Mrs. Waltham hangs up on her.) 
  Phoebe:  Hello? 
 (Cut to Chandler and Monica at the buffet table.) 
  Chandler:  Hey. 
  Monica:  Hey. 
  Chandler:  Oh wow, I hope you don&#146;t take this the wrong way but, I know we
had plans to meet up tonight and, ugh, I&#146;m just kinda worried about what it might do
to our friendship. 
  Monica:  I know. How could we have let this happen? 
  Chandler:  Seven times! 
  Monica:  Ugh! Well, y&#146;know, we were away&#133; 
  Chandler:  In a  foreign , romantic country&#133; 
  Monica:  I blame London. 
  Chandler:  Bad London! (Takes a spoon and smacks the turkey.) 
  Monica:  So look umm, while we&#146;re st-still in London, I mean, we can keep
doing it right? 
  Chandler:  Well, I don&#146;t see that we have a choice. But, when we&#146;re
back home, we don&#146;t do it. 
  Monica:  Only here. 
  Chandler:  Y&#146;know, I saw a wine cellar downstairs&#133; 
  Monica:  I&#146;ll meet you there in two minutes. 
  Chandler:  Okay!  
 (He throws down his plate and runs to the wine cellar, Monica is about to follow him
but is intercepted by Rachel.) 
  Rachel:  Mon, honey, I gotta ask you something. 
  Monica:  (impatiently) Now? 
  Rachel:  Ross said my name up there, I mean, come on, I just can&#146;t pretend
that didn&#146;t happen can I? 
  Monica:  Oh, I-I don&#146;t know. 
  Rachel:  Monica, what should I do? 
  Monica:  Just uh, do the right thing. (Uses some breath spray) 
  Rachel:  What? 
  Monica:  Toe the line. Thread the needle. Think outside the box! (Tries to leave,
but is stopped by Rachel.) 
  Rachel:  Whoa, wait, listen, I think I&#146;m just gonna talk to Ross about what
he think it meant. 
  Monica:  Wait. Rachel, no, he&#146;s married. Married! If you don&#146;t realize
that, I can&#146;t help you. 
  Rachel:  Okay, you&#146;re right. You&#146;re right. You can&#146;t help me. 
 (Cut to Mr. and Mrs. Geller.) 
  Mrs. Geller:  Jack, is it all our fault? Were we bad parents? 
  Mr. Waltham:  (walking by) Yes. 
  Mr. Geller:  Oh yeah, well who serves steak when there&#146;s no place to sit, I
mean how are you supposed to eat this? 
  Joey:  Hey, what&#146;s up? (He has solved the problem of eating the steak,
he&#146;s eating it with his hands.) 
 (Cut to Monica and Chandler, Monica is running up to him.) 
  Monica:  Where were you? We were supposed to meet in the wine cellar? 
  Chandler:  Forget it, that&#146;s off. 
  Monica:  Why?! 
  Mr. Waltham:  (drunkenly) The next tour of the wine cellar will plan in two in-in
minutes&#133; 
 (Joey walks up to them.) 
  Monica:  Joey, what are you doing? You promised Phoebe you wouldn&#146;t eat meat
until she has the babies! 
  Joey:  Well, I figured we&#146;re in another country, so it doesn&#146;t count. 
  Monica:  That&#146;s true. 
  Chandler:  The man&#146;s got a point. 
 (Cut to Rachel and Ross.) 
  Rachel:  Oh, hi! 
  Ross:  Hi! 
  Rachel:  Hi. Sorry, things aren&#146;t working out so well. 
  Ross:  Oh no! It could be better, but it&#146;s gonna be okay, right? 
  Rachel:  Oh yeah! Of course, I mean, she&#146;s gonna get over this, y&#146;know?
I mean, so you said my name! Y&#146;know you just said it &#145;cause you saw me there, if
you&#146;d have seen a circus freak, you would&#146;ve said, I take thee circus
freak. Y&#146;know, it didn&#146;t mean anything, it&#146;s just a mistake. It
didn&#146;t mean anything. Right? 
  Ross:  No! No! Of course it didn&#146;t mean anything! I mean, uh well, I can
understand why Emily would think it meant something, y&#146;know, because-because it was
you&#133; 
  Rachel:  Right&#133; 
  Ross:  But it absolutely didn&#146;t. (Yelling towards the bathroom) It
didn&#146;t!! It didn&#146;t!! 
  Joey:  (approaching) Ross, hey, the band&#146;s ready outside for your first
dance with Emily, so&#133; 
  Ross:  (sarcastic) Oh! Oh-oh, the band&#146;s ready! Well, I-I-we gotta do what
the band says&#151;I don&#146;t care about the stupid band!! 
  Joey:  You spit on me man! (Wipes his face.) 
  Ross:  Look, I&#146;m sorry. 
  Joey:  Emily is kinda taking a long time, huh? 
  Rachel:  (laughs) Y&#146;know when I locked myself in the bathroom at my wedding,
it was because I was trying to pop the window out of the frame. 
  Ross:  Oh, right! 
  Rachel:  Get the hell out of there, y&#146;know? 
 (They all start laughing, and quickly stop when they realize what she just said and run
over to the bathroom.) 
  Ross:  (Bangs on the bathroom door) Emily? Emily? I&#146;m coming in. (He opens
the door to reveal that the window is gone, along with Emily.) 
  Rachel:  Well, look at that, same thing. 
 [Scene:  London Marriott , Monica and Chandler are walking to her room.] 
  Chandler:  Listen, in the middle of everything if I scream the word,
Yippee! just ignore me. 
 (She laughs and opens the door to reveal Rachel sitting on the bed.) 
  Monica:  Oh my God, Rachel! Hi! 
  Chandler:  Oh, hello Rachel. 
  Rachel:  Ross said my name. Okay?  My  name. Ross said my name up there that
obviously means that he still loves me! (They both just stare at her.) Okay, don&#146;t
believe me, I know I&#146;m right&#151;do you guys want to go downstairs and get a drink? 
  Chandler:  Yes, we do. But, we have to change first. 
  Monica:  Yes, I want to change. And why-why don&#146;t you go down and get us a
table? 
  Chandler:  Yeah, we&#146;ll be down in like five minutes. 
  Monica:  (elbows him) Fifteen minutes. 
  Rachel:  Okay. 
 (The phone rings and Rachel answers it.) 
  Rachel:  Hello? Oh, Pheebs! (To them) It&#146;s Phoebe! 
  Chandler:  Oh, yay&#133; 
  Monica:  Great&#133; 
  Rachel:  Hi! 
  Phoebe:  Hi, so what happened? 
  Rachel:  Well, Ross said my name. 
  Phoebe:  Yeah, I know, but I don&#146;t think that means anything. 
  Rachel:  Okay, Pheebs, y&#146;know what, let&#146;s look at this objectively all
right? Ninth grade, right? The obsession starts. All right? The summer after ninth grade
he sees me in a two-piece for the first time, his obsession begins to grow. So then&#133; 
  Chandler:  (To Monica) Hey, listen, why don&#146;t we go change in my room? 
  Monica:  But my clothes are&#151;ohh! (They both leave.) 
 (Cut to Chandler&#146;s room, he opens the door slowly to see if Joey is there and
after seeing that he isn&#146;t, ushers Monica into the room, closes the door, and the
security bar.) 
  Chandler:  Wow, you look&#133; 
  Monica:  No time for that! 
 (They both start to frantically rip each other&#146;s clothes off, but are interrupted
when Joey tries to open the door.) 
  Joey:  Hey, dude, let me in. I got a girl out here! 
  Chandler:  Well, I&#146;ve got a girl in here. 
  Joey:  No you don&#146;t, I just saw you go in there with Monica! 
  Chandler:  Well, we&#146;re-we&#146;re hanging out in here! 
  Joey:  Look, which one of us is gonna be having sex in there, me or you? 
  Chandler:  Well, I suppose I&#146;d have to say you!! But, what if we&#146;re
watching a movie in here? 
  Monica:  Which we are, and-and we already paid for it. It&#146;s  My Giant ! 
  Joey:   My Giant ? I  love  that movie! 
 [Scene: Ross and Emily&#146;s room, Chandler and Monica are still looking for a place
to do the deed.] 
  Monica:  You really think this is okay? 
  Chandler:  Well, Ross and Emily aren&#146;t gonna use it. 
  Monica:  Oh, it&#146;s so beautiful. Ohh! Y&#146;know, I-I don&#146;t know if I
feel right about this. 
  Chandler:  Oh Mon-Mon-Mon-Mon-look, this is the honeymoon suite. The  room 
expects sex. The  room  would be disappointed if it didn&#146;t get sex. All of the
other honeymoon suites would think it was a loser. 
  Monica:  Okay! 
  Chandler:  Okay! 
 (They both run to rip the covers off the bed, but are interrupted by Ross.) 
  Ross:  (entering) Emily?! 
  Chandler:  Nope, not under here! 
  Monica:  You didn&#146;t find her? 
  Ross:  No, I&#146;ve looked everywhere! 
  Chandler:  Well, you couldn&#146;t have looked everywhere or else you
would&#146;ve found her! 
  Monica:  Yeah, I think you should keep looking! 
  Chandler:  Yeah, for about 30 minutes. 
  Monica:  Or 45. 
  Chandler:  Wow, in 45 minutes you can find her twice. (Monica smiles at that.) 
  Ross:  No! For all I know, she&#146;s trying to find me but couldn&#146;t because
I kept moving around. No, from now on, I&#146;m staying in one place. (He sits down on the
bed.) Right here. 
  Monica:  Well, it&#146;s getting late. 
  Chandler:  Yeah, we&#146;re gonna go. 
  Ross:  Actually, do you guys mind staying here for a while? 
  Monica:  Ugh, y&#146;know, umm we gotta get up early and catch that plane for New
York. 
  Chandler:  Yeah, it&#146;s a very large plane. 
  Ross:  (disappointed) That&#146;s cool. 
  Chandler:  But, we&#146;ll stay here with you. 
  Ross:  Thanks guys! (They both sit down on either side of him.) I really
appreciate this, y&#146;know, but you don&#146;t have to rub my butt. 
 (Chandler slowly takes his hand away.) 
  Commercial Break  
 [Scene: Ross and Emily&#146;s room, the next morning. Ross is now asleep and has his
head in Monica&#146;s lap and his feet on Chandler&#146;s lap. Monica and Chandler are
both still awake and depressed.] 
  Chandler:  We have to leave for New York in an hour. 
  Monica:  I know, I&#146;ve been looking at those doors, they look pretty sound
proof, don&#146;t you think? 
  Chandler:  We can&#146;t do that that&#146;s insane. I mean &#145;A&#146; he
could wake up and &#145;B&#146; y&#146;know, let&#146;s go for it. 
 (They both try to slowly extricate themselves from Ross, but there&#146;s a knock on
the door that awakens him.) 
  Ross:  Em-Emily? (Looking around for her.) Em-Emily? (He runs to the door.)
Emily! (He opens the door to reveal the Walthams standing outside.) 
  Mr. Waltham:  No. 
  Mrs. Waltham:  You can forget about Emily, she&#146;s not with us. 
  Mr. Waltham:  We&#146;ve come for her things. 
  Ross:  Wait, well wh-wh-wh-where is she? 
  Mr. Waltham:  She&#146;s in hiding. She&#146;s utterly humiliated. She
doesn&#146;t want to see you ever again. 
  Mrs. Waltham:  We&#146;re very sad that it didn&#146;t work out between you and
Emily, monkey. But, I think you&#146;re absolutely delicious. 
  Mr. Waltham:  Excuse me, I&#146;m standing right here! 
  Mrs. Waltham:  Oh yes, there you are. 
  Rachel:  (entering, carrying an armful of those little soaps.) Hey-hey, you guys
oh hurry up, get some, there&#146;s a whole cart outside&#133; (Sees the Walthams and
stops.) 
  Mr. Waltham:  Goodbye Geller. 
  Ross:  Now, hold on! Hold on! (Stops him) Look, look, your daughter and I are
supposed to leave tonight for our honeymoon, now-now you-you tell her that I&#146;m gonna
be at that airport and I hope that she&#146;ll be there too! Oh yeah, I said Rachel&#146;s
name, but it didn&#146;t mean anything, Okay? She&#146;s-she&#146;s just a friend and
that&#146;s all! (Rachel sits down, depressed.) That&#146;s all! Now just tell Emily that
I love her and that I can&#146;t imagine spending my life with anyone else. Please,
promise me that you&#146;ll tell her that. 
  Mr. Waltham:  All right, I&#146;ll tell her. (To his wife) Come on bugger face! 
  Mrs. Waltham:  (As she walks pass Ross, she pats his but.) Call me. 
  Mr. Waltham:  You spend half your life in the bathroom, why don&#146;t you ever
go out the bloody window! 
 [Scene: A 747 somewhere over the North Atlantic, Monica and Chandler are sitting in
first class, depressed.] 
  Monica:  Y&#146;know, maybe it&#146;s best that we never got to do it again. 
  Chandler:  Yeah, it kinda makes that-that one night special. (Realizes something)
Y&#146;know, technically we still  are  over international waters. 
  Monica:  I&#146;m gonna go to the bathroom, maybe I&#146;ll see you there in a
bit? 
  Chandler:  &#145;Kay! 
 (Monica gets up and heads for the bathroom, Chandler turns to watch her go and is
startled to see Joey sitting in Monica&#146;s seat.) 
  Joey:  Can I ask you something? 
  Chandler:  Uhh, no. 
  Joey:  Felicity and I, we&#146;re watching  My Giant , and I was thinking,
I&#146;m never gonna be as good an actor as that giant. Do you think I&#146;m
just wasting my life with this acting thing? 
  Chandler:  No. 
  Joey:  I mean, the giant is like five years younger than me, y&#146;know, you
think I&#146;ll ever get there? 
  Chandler:  Yes. 
  Joey:  Thanks man.  
  Chandler:  Okay man. (Chandler starts to get up.) 
  Joey:  But what about how much taller he is than me? 
 (Time lapse, Chandler is finishing his third little bottle of booze.) 
  Joey:  I mean, there&#146;s no way I can make myself taller now, y&#146;know? And
who knows what science will come up with in the future, but Chandler, what if I die an
unsuccessful, regular sized man? 
 (Monica returns.) 
  Joey:  Hey, Monica, wow you&#146;ve been in the bathroom for like a half-hour. 
  Monica:  I know! 
  Joey:  Had the beef-tips, huh? 
 [Scene: Monica and Rachel's, Phoebe is eating cereal from a bowl she has balanced on
her stomach as Joey, Chandler, and Monica return.] 
  Phoebe:  Hey! 
  Chandler:  Hey! 
  Joey:  Hi! 
 (They all hug.) 
  Phoebe:  (To Joey) You ate meat! (Joey is shocked) (To Chandler and Monica) You
had sex! (They&#146;re shocked.) 
  Chandler:  No we didn&#146;t! 
  Phoebe:  I know you didn&#146;t, I was talking about Monica. 
  Monica:  Phoebe, I did not have sex. 
  Phoebe:  This pregnancy is throwing me all off. 
  Joey:  All right, I&#146;m gonna go say hi the chick and the duck. 
  Phoebe:  Oh, me too! 
  Joey:  Why would you need to say hi to them, you&#146;ve been feeding them for
four days? 
  Phoebe:  Oh right, maybe I&#146;ll just go home.  
 (She grabs her bag and leaves, Joey moves a little quicker to his apartment, leaving
Monica and Chandler alone.) 
  Monica:  Well, we certainly are alone. 
  Chandler:  Yes! Good thing we have that, &#145;Not in New York&#146; rule. 
  Monica:  Right. Umm, listen since we&#146;re-we-re on that subject, umm, I just
wanted to tell you that uh, well, I-I was going through a really hard time in London, what
with my brother getting married and that guy thinking I was Ross&#146;s mother&#133; 
  Chandler:  Right. 
  Monica:  Well, an-anyway, I just&#151;that night meant a lot to me, I guess
I&#146;m just trying to say thanks. 
  Chandler:  Oh. Y&#146;know, that night meant a lot to me too, and it wasn&#146;t
because I was in a bad place or anything, it just meant a lot to me &#145;cause,
you&#146;re really hot! Is that okay? 
  Monica:  (laughs) That&#146;s okay. 
  Chandler:  And I&#146;m cute too. 
  Monica:  And you&#146;re cute too. 
  Chandler:  Thank you! (They hug.) All right, I gotta go unpack. 
  Monica:  Okay. 
  Chandler:  Bye.  
 (After he closes the door, Monica starts to follow him, but thinks better of it and
stops.) 
  Chandler:  (entering) I&#146;m still on London time, does that count? 
  Monica:  That counts! 
  Chandler:  Oh, good! (They start kissing.) 
 [Scene: An airport in London, Ross is waiting for Emily to show up to go on their
honeymoon and sees Rachel walking past.] 
  Ross:  Rach! Rach! 
  Rachel:  (she stops and turns) Hi! 
  Ross:  Hi! What are you, what are you doing here? 
  Rachel:  Well, I-I-I&#146;ve been on Standby for a flight home for hours.  
  Ross:  Oh. 
  Rachel:  Ohh, so no sign of Emily huh? 
  Ross:  Not yet. 
  Rachel:  So umm, what time are you supposed to leave? 
  Gate Agent:  (On the P.A.) This is the last call for Flight 1066 to
Athens. The last call. 
  Ross:  Pretty soon I guess. 
  Rachel:  Yeah. I&#146;m sorry. 
  Ross:  I just, I don&#146;t understand, I mean, how-how can she do this?
Y&#146;know, what, am I, am I like a complete idiot for thinking that she&#146;d actually
show up? 
  Rachel:  No, you&#146;re not an idiot, Ross. You&#146;re a guy very much in love. 
  Ross:  Same difference. 
  Gate Agent:  (On the P.A.) All ticketed passengers for Flight 1066 to
Athens should now be on board. 
  Ross:  I get it! Well, that&#146;s that. 
  Rachel:  No, you know what, I think you should go. 
  Ross:  What? 
  Rachel:  Yeah, I do. I think you should go, by yourself, get some distance, clear
your head, I think it&#146;d be really good. 
  Ross:  Oh, I don&#146;t, I don&#146;t, I don&#146;t know&#133; 
  Rachel:  Oh, come on Ross! I think it would be  really  good for you! 
  Ross:  I could, yeah, I can do that. 
  Rachel:  Yeah. 
  Ross:  I can&#146;t, I can&#146;t even believe her! No, y&#146;know what, I am, I
am gonna go! 
  Rachel:  Good! 
  Ross:  I know, why not? 
  Rachel:  Right! 
  Ross:  Right? 
  Rachel:  Right! 
  Ross:  Y&#146;know&#151;thanks! (They hug) 
  Rachel:  Okay, I&#146;ll see you back at home, if I ever get a flight out of
here. 
  Ross:  Yeah, well&#133;nah. 
  Rachel:  What? Wait, what? 
  Ross:  Why don&#146;t you come, I mean, I-I have two tickets, why not? 
  Rachel:  Well-well, I don&#146;t know Ross&#151;really? 
  Ross:  Yeah, yeah, it&#146;ll be great! You can, you can lay on the beach and I
can cry over my failed marriage. See-see how I make jokes? 
  Rachel:  Uh-huh. 
  Ross:  No really, I mean, I mean, God, I could use a friend. 
  Rachel:  Oh wow, uh okay, uh maybe. Umm, yes, I can do that! 
  Ross:  Okay! 
  Rachel:  Okay! 
  Ross:  Cool! 
  Rachel:  All right! 
  Ross:  Come on! (They go to the jetway, Ross hands the tickets to the gate
agent.) Here.  
  Rachel:  Oh, okay, we&#146;re going. Yeah. 
  Ross:  Ah! Ah! I forgot my jacket! 
  Rachel:  Oh, wait-wait-wait&#133; 
  Ross:  You tell them to wait! 
  Rachel:  Okay. Wait! Wait! 
 (Ross retrieves his jacket and sees that not only has Emily arrived, but she as seen
Rachel take her place on the plane.) 
  Ross:  Emily. 
 (She stares at him and Ross realizes what she&#146;s thinking.) 
  Ross:  Oh no-no-no! Oh-no! (Emily starts to run out and Ross chases her.) No! No!
Emily! 
  Ending Credits  
 [Scene: Flight 1066 to Athens, Rachel is ordering a drink for Ross and herself.] 
  Rachel:  Ahh, yes, I will have a glass of the Merlot and uh, (points to
Ross&#146;s seat.) he will have a white wine spritzer. Woo! (Looks out the window.) Hey,
look at that, the airport&#146;s moving. (Realizes that that&#146;s not how it works.)
Hey, are we moving?! Are we moving? Why are we moving? Hey, time-out, umm, yeah, does the
captain know that we&#146;re moving? (Sits back in defeat.) Oh my God. Oh, my gosh.
