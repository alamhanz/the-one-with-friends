 [Scene: Joey and Rachel's, Joey is eating breakfast as Rachel enters having just woken
up.] 
  Joey:  Morning! 
  Rachel:  Hi! Oh, how was your date last night? 
  Joey:  Pretty good. 
  Rachel:  Oh good. (She walks to the closed bathroom door, opens it, and finds a
naked woman wrapped in a towel.) Ahhh! My God, sorry! (She closes the door and confronts
Joey.) 
  Joey:  Okay, really good. Anyway I gotta go; I&#146;m late for work. 
  Rachel:  What-what?! You&#146;re gonna leave this person with me?! 
  Joey:  Yeah&#151;Hey, don&#146;t worry, she&#146;s a terrific girl. And hey
listen, could you do me a favor? When she comes out could you just mention that I&#146;m
not looking for a serious relationship; that&#146;d be great. 
  Rachel:  Why?! What?! Are you kidding?! 
  Joey:  Just casually slip it in, y&#146;know lay the groundwork. Tell her uh,
I&#146;m a loner&#151;No! An outlaw! Tell her she doesn&#146;t want to get mixed up with
the likes of me. 
  Rachel:  Y&#146;know what? That&#146;s a lot to remember, can&#146;t I just tell
her you&#146;re a pig? 
  Joey:  Hey, I&#146;m gonna call her later! Honest! Oh come on, Chandler used to
do it! He&#146;d even make the girl pancakes! Plus, he&#146;d make extras and leave
&#145;em for me. 
  Rachel:  Well forget it, I&#146;m not telling that girl anything. That is not my
responsibility. 
  Joey:  Fine! (Pause) Now, where&#146;d we land on those pancakes? (She chases him
out the door as his date emerges from the bathroom.) 
 
 Joey&#146;s Date:  Hi! 
  Rachel:  Hi. 
 
 Joey&#146;s Date:  Sorry about that, but I couldn&#146;t get that lock to work on
the door. 
  Rachel:  Yeah, Joey kinda disabled it when I moved in. 
 
 Joey&#146;s Date:  You must be Rachel, I&#146;m Erin. 
  Rachel:  Hi. 
  Erin:  Hi. I don&#146;t mean this to sound like high school, but did he say
anything about me? 
  Rachel:  (pause) Would you like some pancakes? 
  Opening Credits  
 [Scene: N.Y.U&#146;s University Library, Ross is entering with Chandler.] 
  Chandler:  &#133;Come on! Why are we here?! 
  Ross:  Okay, okay take a guess. 
 (An old woman pushes a cart full of books past.) 
  Chandler:  The hot chicks? 
  Ross:  Okay, okay, I was typing names into the library computer earlier,
y&#146;know-y&#146;know for fun, and I typed mine in and guess what came up? My doctoral
dissertation! It&#146;s here! Yeah, it&#146;s right-it&#146;s right down here! In the
biggest library in the university! (They start heading that way, towards a secluded
section behind the racks.) 
  Chandler:  Wow that&#146;s actually pretty cool. 
  Ross:  (stopping quickly) Oh umm, there&#146;s also a book here by a woman named
Wendy Bagina. (They both laugh, but stop when the hear moaning coming from the next
aisle.) What is that? 
  Chandler:  Sounds like two people are really enjoying the Dewey decimal system. 
 (They go around the last row of bookshelves and find a couple doing what college coeds
do in secluded corners of university libraries. For those of you who don&#146;t know what
I&#146;m talking about, let&#146;s just say that clothing is undone. Ross gasps and the
couple gets up and runs away.) 
  Female Student:  (as they are moving past Ross) I&#146;m so sorry! 
  Male Student:  Sorry! 
  Chandler:  You didn&#146;t bring me here to do that, did you? 
 [Scene: Monica&#146;s Restaurant Kitchen, Monica is cooking as a waitress enters
carrying a plate of food that has been sent back.] 
  Monica:  She sent the chicken back again?! 
  The Waitress:  She says it&#146;s to dry now and she wants to come back here and
explain to you  exactly  how she wants it. 
  Monica:  Well fine! I want to meet this chicken expert! Send the Colonel in! 
 (The waitress lets her in as Monica is about to throw a lobster into a pot of boiling
water (Although, she hasn&#146;t taken off the rubber bands that hold the claws, so she
can&#146;t be  that  good of a chef). Anyway, guess who the Colonel is by the
following phrase.) 
 
 The Colonel:  OH&#133;MY&#133;GAWD!!!! (Yep, it&#146;s Janice.) 
  Monica:  (to the lobster) Lucky bastard! (Throws the lobster in and turns around
to face the planet&#146;s most annoying woman, next to Dr. Laura and Kathy Lee Gifford of
course. She&#146;s the most annoying female TV character however.) Janice. 
  Janice:  How are you Ms. Hot Shot chef with the big fancy restaurant with the
best chicken ever! (Does the laugh.) 
  Monica:  I&#146;m fine. 
  Janice:  (notices Monica&#146;s engagement ring) Ohh! What is that on your
finger?! I&#146;m blind! 
  Monica:  Oh&#133; Uh&#133; 
  Janice:  So, who&#146;s the lucky guy? 
 [Cut to Monica and Chandler&#146;s just after Monica has finished telling Chandler what
happened.] 
  Chandler:  OH&#133;MY&#133;GAWD! I am so sorry sweetie, are you okay? You
didn&#146;t tell her we were getting married, did you? 
  Monica:  Well, she saw the ring. 
  Chandler:  Did she freak out? 
  Monica:  Well, she was shocked when I told her, but then again so were most
people. 
  Chandler:  Right. 
  Monica:  Well, she actually has a boyfriend y&#146;know herself, named Clark. Uh,
she also kinda invited herself to our wedding. Clark too. 
  Chandler:  (laughs) You said no right? 
  Monica:  Huh? 
  Chandler:  You said  no  right?! 
  Monica:  Well, she corned me! She asked if the wedding was in town! I mean, what
was I supposed to do?! 
  Chandler:  Lie!!! How hard is that?! The check&#146;s in the mail! Oh your baby
is so cute! I can&#146;t wait to read your book Ross!! 
  Monica:  Come on! So she comes to the wedding! I mean it won&#146;t be so bad. 
  Chandler:  What do you think she&#146;s just gonna sit there quietly? You
don&#146;t think she&#146;s gonna want to make a toast? You don&#146;t think she&#146;s
gonna want to grab the microphone and sing  Part-time Lover ?! 
  Monica:  Oh my God, she&#146;s not gonna like the chicken that night either is
she?! 
  Chandler:  Y&#146;know what? It&#146;s gonna be okay. Y&#146;know what?
She&#146;s probably not gonna even want to come. 
  Monica:  Really? 
  Chandler:  No! That was a  lie ! See how easy that was? 
  Monica:  So-so you would&#146;ve just lied? 
  Chandler:  Yes!! 
  Monica:  Would it really have been that easy? 
  Chandler:  Yes!!! 
  Monica:  Good, so do it Saturday night because we&#146;re going to dinner with
her and Clark. 
 [Scene: Joey and Rachel's, Joey is coming back from work to find Phoebe, Rachel, and
someone else with her back turned is there.] 
  Joey:  Hey! What&#146;s up? 
 
 Phoebe and  Rachel:   Hey! 
  Joey:  Hey-hey, who&#146;s your friend? (Erin turns around to face Joey,
startling him) Hey!! 
  Erin:  Hey Joey! 
  Joey:  Erin! Still here! 
  Rachel:  Yeah, we ended up spending the day together and had such a great time! 
  Joey:  Why wouldn&#146;t ya? Erin is great! Then-then there&#146;s you guys. 
  Erin:  Ohh, listen. I&#146;ve got to get going. Today was great, thanks! 
  Rachel:  I know! 
  Phoebe:  Okay! 
  Erin:  Bye Joey. (Kisses him.) Last night was fun. 
  Joey:  Yeah. I&#146;ll uh, I&#146;ll call ya. 
  Rachel:  Oh and I&#146;ll call ya too! 
  Erin:  Or I&#146;ll call you! 
  Phoebe:  And call me! 
  Joey:  (to Erin) Okay, good to see you again. 
  Erin:  Bye. 
  Joey:  Bye-bye. 
  Rachel:  Bye! 
 (Joey closes the door behind her.)  
  Joey:  So, system kinda broke down huh?! 
  Rachel:  Oh Joey, I&#146;m sorry I just couldn&#146;t tell her all those things
you wanted me to tell her. And y&#146;know we got to talking and I&#133; 
  Phoebe:  We want you to marry her! 
  Joey:  What?!! 
  Phoebe:  She is so amazing! You have no idea. 
  Joey:  No idea? Who do you think brought her here? 
  Rachel:  Cupid. 
  Phoebe:  Joey, she&#146;s so cool. She speaks four languages. 
  Joey:  Man, do  you  know what guys want! 
  Rachel:  Look Joey, come on she&#146;s so perfect for you! I mean she&#146;s
sweet, she-she likes baseball, and she-she had two beers at lunch. 
  Joey:  My beers?! Look you guys, she&#146;s a very nice girl. Okay? We had a good
time, but I just&#151;I don&#146;t see it going anywhere. 
  Phoebe:  Yeah, but you always say that. 
  Rachel:  Yeah, maybe if you gave this girl a chance it would go somewhere. 
  Joey:  Look I&#146;m sorry you guys, I-I just don&#146;t think so. 
  Phoebe:  Whatever. 
  Rachel:  Fine. (They start to walk away.) 
  Joey:  Hey, don&#146;t start judging me! (To Rachel) Huh? You&#146;re the one
who&#146;s in love with her assistant! (To Phoebe) Huh? And you, you&#146;re the one
having the affair with the guy who keeps the pigeons on the roof! 
  Rachel:  Phoebe! 
  Phoebe:   Secret  affair! 
 [Scene: Central Perk, Rachel and Joey are there as Ross enters.] 
  Ross:  People are doing it in front of my book! 
  Rachel:  I&#146;m sorry? 
  Ross:  My doctoral dissertation is in the library at school, I went to see it,
and there were students makin&#146; babies right in the middle of the Paleontology
section! 
  Rachel:  Oh my God! Did you get to see anything good? 
  Ross:  Let me ask you something, at your school was there a like uh a place on
campus where students went to uh, fool around. 
  Rachel:  Yeah, there was. It was&#151;there the corner of the library where-where
all these dusty books that nobody ever read&#151;Yes, there was. 
  Ross:  Great! Because people kept showing up, I think it&#146;s like uh-a thing! 
  Joey:  Now hold on a second, fifth floor against that back wall? 
  Ross:  Oh for cryin&#146; out loud! (He storms out.) 
  Joey:  All right, so we should go catch our movie. 
  Rachel:  Well now what&#146;s the rush? 
  Joey:  I like to see the previews. (Rachel looks at him.) The candy. 
  Phoebe:  (entering with Erin) Oh. Hey! 
  Rachel:  Well look who&#146;s here! 
  Erin:  Hey! 
  Joey:  Hey! 
  Erin:  Joey. 
  Joey:  Erin. 
  Erin:  Hey Rachel. 
  Rachel:  Hi! Well, we were just about to take off and see a movie. Oh no! 
  Erin:  What&#146;s wrong? 
  Rachel:  Oh Phoebe, we forgot that party we have to go to. 
  Phoebe:  Oh no. 
  Joey:  (skeptical) What party? 
 
 Phoebe and  Rachel:   A birthday party. 
  Joey:  Who&#146;s birthday party? 
 
 Phoebe and  Rachel:   Allison&#146;s birthday party. 
  Joey:  (still skeptical) Oh, and how is Allison? 
 
 Phoebe and  Rachel:   32. (Joey&#146;s not buying it.) 
  Rachel:  (does a retching sound) Wait a minute! Why don&#146;t you guys do
something?! 
  Joey:  (still skeptical) Yeah, look how that worked out. 
  Commercial Break  
 [Scene: The Library, Ross enters and heads to the desk to talk to the male librarian on
duty.] 
  Ross:  Excuse me. Hi, I&#146;m a professor here. Do you know the Paleontology
section, fifth floor, stack 437? 
  The Librarian:  Well, yes! Just give me five minutes, I just have to find someone
to cover my shift. 
  Ross:  No! No!! No! Can I speak to someone in charge please?! (The librarian
brings his boss over.) 
  The Head Librarian:  How can I help you? 
  Ross:  Hi, I was wondering if it is possible to increase security in the
Paleontology section? See I-I wrote a book up there and instead of reading it people
are-are-are well, rolling around in front of it. 
  The Head Librarian:  We are aware of the problem you are referring too. (He turns
to look at the previous librarian.) But as far as increasing security, I&#146;m afraid the
library is very understaffed. I, I can&#146;t help you. 
  Ross:  Well, fine. Fine! If-if I&#146;m the only person with any appreciation of
the sanctity of the written word, I&#146;ll go up there and defend it myself! (Starts to
do so, but stops and to the previous librarian) And don&#146;t you follow me! 
 [Scene: Joey and Rachel's, Rachel and Phoebe are doing dishes as Joey enters.] 
  Joey:  Hey. 
  Phoebe:  Hey! 
  Rachel:  How did it go with Erin? 
  Joey:  Oh, unbelievable! We had the best time! 
  Phoebe:  Yay!! Oh so, you&#146;re not, you&#146;re not mad at us anymore? 
  Joey:  No! No! No! You guys were totally right! This is so much better than the
first time we went out. Y&#146;know? That was so awkward, we were really nervous. 
  Phoebe:  Didn&#146;t you sleep together? 
  Joey:  Yeah that really calms me down. And! We have so much in common! She loves
sandwiches, sports, although she is a Met fan, not much of an issue now but if were ever
to have kids, well that&#146;s a&#133; 
  Rachel:  (gasps) Oh my God! Listen to you talkin&#146; about having kids. Oh my
Joey. (She goes over and hugs him.) Oh, please don&#146;t get married before I do. 
  Joey:  Okay. 
 [Scene: A Restaurant, Monica and Chandler are on their date with Janice and Clark,
however Clark is a no show and Janice is crying the Mississippi River about it.] 
  Janice:  Oh. Oh I just cannot believe Clark stood me up! 
  Monica:  He might still show up. 
  Janice:  Oh, what are you, stupid? It&#146;s been three hours. 
  Monica:  Is that all? 
  Janice:  I should just go on to happier things, okay? Umm, why don&#146;t you
tell about your lovely wedding? 
  Chandler:  Well actually uh, there was something we wanted to tell you about the
wedding. Um, it&#146;s going to be a small ceremony. Uh, tiny! We&#146;re not even sure
why we&#146;re having it. 
  Monica:  It&#146;s actually going to be just family. 
  Janice:  Oh&#133;wait&#133;you two think of me as family?! Oh, I have to ask you
something now and be honest; do you want me to sing  Careless Whisper  or  Lady In
Red ? 
 [Scene: Central Perk, Joey is entering and arguing baseball with Erin. Phoebe and
Rachel are already there.] 
  Joey:  How can you say that?! The  Mets  have no closer! 
  Erin:  What about Benitez? 
  Joey:  What about Game 1 of the Series? 
  Erin:  What about shut up? 
  Joey:  You shut up! (To Phoebe and Rachel) I love arguing with her. (To Erin)
I&#146;ll be right back.  
  Erin:  Okay. (Joey goes to get some coffee and Erin sits down.) 
  Rachel:  So how&#146;s it goin&#146; with Joey? 
  Erin:  Uh, okay. 
  Rachel:  Okay? Wait okay, tell-tell me that you like him, please? I mean tell me
that you like him. 
  Erin:  Look, he&#146;s a really great guy and I know that  you  really want
this to work out, but I just don&#146;t see this having a future. 
  Rachel:  But you said that you liked him! I mean what happened?! Did ya just
change your mind?! 
  Erin:  Kinda. 
  Phoebe:  Then change it back! 
  Erin:  I&#146;m sorry I&#133; It&#146;s just there&#146;s no real spark. 
  Phoebe:  No spark? Didn&#146;t you sleep together? 
  Erin:  Yeah. 
  Rachel:  Ugh, tramp! 
  Phoebe:  Does Joey have any idea? 
  Erin:  I really don&#146;t think he does. And y&#146;know what? Maybe you guys
could help clue him in. Y&#146;know, tell him I&#146;m-I&#146;m not interested in a
serious relationship or something. 
  Phoebe:  Yeah, you mean like that you&#146;re kind of a loner. 
  Erin:  Yeah! That would be great! 
  Phoebe:  Yeah, and maybe that you&#146;re a real (She says something in Italian,
and it doesn&#146;t matter what she said. It&#146;s not important so I don&#146;t need
everyone who speaks Italian telling me what she said.) 
  Erin:  I&#146;m sorry? 
  Phoebe:  Oh well, I guess Italian isn&#146;t one of the four languages you speak. 
  Joey:  (returning) Hey! You wanna go? 
  Erin:  Yeah, let&#146;s go. 
  Joey:  Okay. See you guys later. 
  Erin:  Bye guys. 
  Rachel:  Yeah, see ya. 
  Joey:  (whispers to Phoebe and Rachel) Hey, thank you so much. (They both exit.) 
  Rachel:  Wow. Well, I guess it was Cupid who brought her here. 
  Phoebe:  No, just a regular old flying dwarf. 
 [Scene: The library&#146;s Paleontology section, Ross is patrolling as a couple walks
up.] 
  Ross:  Yes? Yes?! How can I help you? 
  Guy:  Yeah, we were&#133;we were just looking around. 
  Ross:  Oh-oh, you&#146;re-you&#146;re fellow scholars. What exactly were you
looking for, hmm? Perhaps, (Grabs a book from the shelf behind him) perhaps Dr. Chester
Stock&#146;s musings on the Smiledon Californicus? 
  Guy:  Uhh&#133;. 
  Ross:  Ah&#133; Ah&#133;Get out of here! (The couple retreats. Ross starts
looking through the previously mentioned book as a beautiful woman walks into the
section.) Uh, meeting someone? Or-or are you just here to brush up on Marion&#146;s views
on evolution? 
  Woman:  Uh, actually I find Marion&#146;s views far to progressionist. 
  Ross:  I find Marion&#146;s views far to progressionist. 
  Woman:  I&#146;m sorry, who are you? 
  Ross:  I&#146;m a professor here uh, Ross&#133;Geller. 
  Woman:  Ross Geller, why do I know that name? It&#146;s uh&#151;Wait! (Grabs his
book off of the shelf.) Did you write this? 
  Ross:  Yes! You&#146;re the person who checked out my book?! 
  Woman:  Y&#146;know, you look nothing like I would&#146;ve thought.
You&#146;re&#133;you&#146;re so young. 
  Ross:  Well I uh, I skipped forth grade. 
 [Time Lapse, Ross and the woman are now in a state of partial undress and are standing
in front of the head librarian with two security guards watching them.] 
  Ross:  I am very&#133;very sorry. 
 [Scene: Joey and Rachel's, Phoebe and Rachel are watching TV as Joey enters.] 
  Joey:  Hey! 
  Phoebe:  Hey! 
  Rachel:  Hi! 
  Phoebe:  So how was, how was your date? 
  Joey:  Oh, it was great! I mean we walked all around the village. We went to this
ice cream place, split a milkshake, 70/30 but still&#133; And guess what, I&#146;m
thinking about taking her upstate to one of those bed and breakfasts. 
  Phoebe:  Oh really? She said she wants to go away with you? 
  Joey:  No-no-no-no-no! It&#146;s a surprise, but it&#146;s gonna be tricky
thought because she said she was gonna be pretty busy at work for a while. 
 
 Phoebe and  Rachel:   Oh no, yeah. 
  Rachel:  Jo-Joey, look honey we-we need to talk okay? Umm, I kinda got the
feeling from her today that uh, she&#146;s not lookin&#146; for a serious relationship. 
  Joey:  Where are you gettin&#146; this? 
  Rachel:  Well, she told me. She said she&#146;s kinda a loner. 
  Joey:  Oh. Oh. 
  Rachel:  Joey&#133; 
  Joey:  No hey Rach, it&#146;s cool okay? Y&#146;know I&#146;m a loner too! (Heads
for his room.) Right? 
  Phoebe:  Hey Joey, y&#146;know what? You are way to good for her. 
  Rachel:  Yeah and honey I promise next time that I will just say good-bye and
tell &#145;em you&#146;re not looking for a relationship. 
  Joey:  No! No. Don&#146;t do that, just next time make sure she really likes me. 
  Rachel:  Well that too. (Joey goes into his room.) Joey? 
  Joey:  Yeah? 
  Rachel:  Do you want some pancakes? 
  Joey:  (coming back out) Finally! 
 [Scene: Monica, Chandler, and Phoebe's, Chandler and Monica are sitting at the kitchen
table and are still trying to decide what to do about Janice.] 
  Monica:  What are we gonna do? 
  Chandler:  I say we go with  Careless Whisper . 
 (There&#146;s a knock on the door and Janice enters.) 
  Janice:  Chandler? 
  Chandler:  (To Monica) Did she see us yet? Did she see us? 
  Monica:  Janice, what umm, what are you doing here? 
  Janice:  Well umm, I thought I was going to go back to my apartment but then I
just felt I couldn&#146;t really be alone tonight. (Joey walks into view of the open door
behind Janice, sees her, gets a terrified look on his face, and flees in horror.) I was
wondering if I could maybe stay here with you, just I really feel that I need to be with
family. 
  Monica:  (To Chandler) Our kids are gonna call her Aunt Janice aren&#146;t they? 
  Janice:  Please, it&#146;s because otherwise I really don&#146;t know what I
might do. 
  Chandler:  Aren&#146;t you just a tinsy bit curious? 
  Janice:  (starting to cry) Do you have any tissues? 
  Monica:  Yeah, in-in-in the bathroom. 
  Janice:  Okay! (She runs for the bathroom) 
  Monica:  We&#146;ll just&#133;we&#146;ll just let her stay. 
  Chandler:  No-no-no-no, if we let her stay, she will stay  forever ! 
  Monica:  Kinda like your Barca lounger. 
  Chandler:  Is that what you&#146;re thinking about right now? 
  Monica:  I  never  stop thinking about it. 
  Janice:  Hey you guys, umm do either one of you want to get in there before I
take my bath. 
  Chandler:  Janice, I&#146;m sorry but umm, you can&#146;t stay here tonight. 
  Janice:  Why not? 
  Chandler:  Honestly? Our apartment is a hotbed for electromagnetic activity. Now
Monica and I have been immunized, but sadly  you  have not. 
 (And she does the laugh.) 
  Janice:  Okay, I&#146;m going to need a comforter, but did you have a
hypoallergenic one because otherwise I get very nasal. (Makes some weird sound) Do you
have a cat? &#145;Cause it&#146;s already happening. (Makes a nasal sound) Do you hear
that? (She keeps making the nasal sound.) 
 (Chandler does the same nasal sound to Chandler.) 
  Monica:  Oh my God! Oh my God! You have to go! 
  Janice:  Why? 
  Monica:  Because Chandler still has feelings for you! 
  Janice:  He does? 
  Chandler:  Say again? 
  Monica:  That&#146;s right. That&#146;s right. And that is why you can&#146;t
stay here tonight. And probably why you shouldn&#146;t come to the wedding. 
  Chandler:  Feelings, such strong feelings. 
  Monica:  I mean, I realize that his feelings may never completely go away, but  you 
can. 
  Janice:  Oh&#133;my Gawd, I-I understand. I-I am so sorry, I&#146;ll go. (Starts
for the door.) Good-bye Monica (hugs her), I wish you a lifetime of happiness with him.
Chandler, (hugs him) you call me when this goes in the pooper. (Hurries out.) 
  Ending Credits  
 [Scene: The library&#146;s Paleontology section, Ross is on patrol and stops a security
guard through the stack of books.] 
  Ross:  (to the guard) Don&#146;t sweat it, I&#146;ve got this section covered.
Yeah, in fact I&#146;ve got this little baby (Turns on a mini-flashlight) to shine in
people&#146;s eye&#151;(The guard walks away)&#151;Okay, see you later.  
 (Ross resumes his patrol when his best friend and sister walk up and start to take off
their coats, but they stop when they see him.) 
  Chandler:  I just wanted to show Monica your book. (Ross just glares at him.)
