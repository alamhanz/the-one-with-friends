 [Scene: Central Perk, Joey, Monica, and Rachel are sitting on the couch and Ross is
sitting on the chair, and they&#146;re all talking.]  
  Rachel:  Hey! Out of all of us, who do you think is gonna get married next? 
  Joey:  Probably Monica and Chandler. 
 (A woman walks up to Gunther in the background.) 
  Woman:  (to Gunther) Hi. Could I have a pack of  Newport Lights ,
please? 
  Gunther:  Oh umm, uh we don&#146;t sell cigarettes, but they have them at the
newsstand across the street. (Points.) 
  Woman:  That&#146;d be great, thanks. (Gunther goes and gets them.) 
  Rachel:  (to the gang) Oh my God, Melissa Warburton. I don&#146;t think I have
the energy for this. 
  Melissa:  (Gasps when she notices Rachel) Oh my God! Ray-ray Green?! (Screams) 
  Rachel:  (screaming) Melissa! 
  Melissa:  You have been M.I.A for the past seven sorority newsletters,
what&#146;s up with you?! 
  Rachel:  Wh&#151;(Turns and looks at the gang who&#146;s staring)&#151;Why
don&#146;t I tell you over here? (She walks Melissa away from the gang.) 
  Melissa:  So last I heard you were gonna get married. (Grabs Rachel&#146;s hand
and notices that she doesn&#146;t have a ring on it.) (Sadly) Oh poor Ray-ray. 
  Rachel:  Oh no-no, no! It&#146;s good! It&#146;s all good! I-I actually work at  Ralph
Lauren ! 
  Melissa:  Shut up! 
  Rachel:  I will not! I&#146;m the divisional head of men&#146;s sportswear! 
  Melissa:  Oh shut up more! Now, are you friends with Ralph? 
  Rachel:  Oh please&#133; 
  Melissa:  (excitedly) Are you?! 
  Rachel:  No. 
  Melissa:  Listen, we-we have to have dinner. What-what are you doing tomorrow
night? 
  Rachel:  Oh tomorrow, oh I don&#146;t know. Um&#133; 
  Melissa:  You do now. You&#146;re having dinner with me. 
  Rachel:  Shut up. 
  Melissa:  I-I&#146;ve got to go. This has been so great Ray-ray! (Gunther returns
with her cigarettes.) Oh, there you are. (Takes them from Gunther.) (To Rachel) Umm, so
listen, just call me. Here&#146;s my card. (Hands the card over.) 
  Rachel:  Oh, wow thanks! (Reading the card) Oh you&#146;re in real estate! 
  Melissa:  Oh no, that&#146;s-that&#146;s an old card. Umm, I wanted to get out of
that and-and do something where I can really help people and-and make a difference. 
  Rachel:  Wow! What do you do now? 
  Melissa:  (quietly) I&#146;m a party planner. I&#146;ll see you tomorrow.
(Exits.) 
  Rachel:  Okay! (Joins the rest of the gang.) 
  Joey:  Hey guys! Look who&#146;s back! It&#146;s Ray-ray! 
  Rachel:  Shut up that was my friend Melissa from college. 
  Ross:  She seems  really ,  really  fun! 
  Rachel:  She&#146;s actually very sweet and we used to be very close. 
  Monica:  Wait a minute, she isn&#146;t&#133; She&#146;s not the one who you&#133; 
  Joey:  (excitedly) Who you what? Who you what?! 
  Rachel:  (To Monica) Yes. 
  Monica:  Wow! 
  Joey:  (excitedly) Wow? Wow what?! Wow what?! Who you&#151;what?!! 
  Rachel:  It&#146;s not a big deal! 
  Monica:  (To Joey) They were lovers. 
  Ross:  What?! 
  Joey:  What?! 
  Rachel:  No we weren&#146;t! It was nothing! It was one night, senior year we
went to a party, had a  lot  of sangria and y&#146;know, ended up&#133;kissing for a
bit. 
  Ross:  So that&#146;s two of my wives. 
  Opening Credits  
 [Scene: Monica and Chandler's, Monica is working on the seating chart while Chandler
looks on and Rachel reads.] 
  Monica:  (telling Chandler the seating arrangement) Okay so this is where the
band is. (Points.) And this is where the bar is. (Points) And all these pins have
people&#146;s names on them. (She has pins to show the seating at each of the tables.) And
Rach, here you are. (Points to Rachel&#146;s place.) 
  Rachel:  Oh wow. Why don&#146;t we just take me (Grabs her pin) and put me with a
Manhattan in my hand, talking to the cute bartender. (Puts her pin at the bar and laughs.
Monica just glares at her.) These pins aren&#146;t for playing are they? 
  Monica:  (To Chandler) Okay, the red ones are my guests and the blue ones are
yours. 
  Chandler:  This is so sad. I mean, I only have like ten pins. 
  Monica:  Chandler, relax it&#146;s not a contest. (To Rachel) Certainly not a
close one. 
  Joey:  (entering) Hello! 
  Rachel:  Hey! 
  Joey:  Hey Rach. (Stares at her.)  
  Rachel:  Stop picturing it!! 
  Monica:  Okay, I think that&#146;s it. The seating chart is done. This is our
wedding. They all look like they&#146;re having fun don&#146;t they? 
  Joey:  Hey, so where are my parents gonna be? 
  Monica:  Oh! (Gets up) Let&#146;s see, well&#133;if this is the wedding hall then
umm (Walks away) you&#146;re parents will be at home in Queens. 
  Joey:  What they&#146;re not invited?! Oh no, that&#146;s terrible! They&#146;re
gonna be crushed! 
  Monica:  Why would they think they&#146;re invited? 
  Joey:  (looking around) You got me. I don&#146;t&#133; 
  Monica:  Joey! 
  Joey:  Well, I&#146;m sorry. I thought parents were coming! Y&#146;know? Your
parents are comin&#146;! Chandler&#146;s parents are comin&#146;! Ross&#146;s parents are
comin&#146;! 
  Monica:  Ross&#146;s parents are  my  parents! 
  Joey:  Well-well&#151;see? Parents are comin&#146;! 
  Chandler:  Y&#146;know I think we should invite them. 
  Monica:  Oh please, you just want more blue pins. 
  Chandler:  Well this is just sad! 
  Monica:  All right, all right. Maybe I can fit them in if I just do some
rearranging. But uh, Rachel may actually have to sit at the bar! 
  Rachel:  That is not a problem. 
  Joey:  (leaning down to her) Maybe you&#146;ll order a little sangria? 
  Rachel:  Oh, get out of here! (Jumps back and walks away.) 
 [Scene:  Ralph Lauren , Rachel is showing Chandler the selection of tuxedos.] 
  Rachel:  (motioning to a rack) So now, these are all the tuxedos that we make and
if there&#146;s anything that you like, we can make you a deal. Anything at all. (Grabs a
few) But these are the three that Monica pre-approved. 
  Chandler:  Well, thanks a lot for hookin&#146; me up Rach. I want you to know
that I want you to attend our wedding as my guest. 
  Rachel:  I&#146;m Monica&#146;s maid of honor. Okay? Don&#146;t try to blue pin
me! 
  Chandler:  (sees another rack) Well, what&#146;s the deal with these? These-these
look nice. 
  Rachel:  Oh they are nice. We-we custom-make tuxedos for celebrities and then
when they&#146;re done with them they just send &#145;em back. 
  Chandler:  You mean like for award shows? 
  Rachel:  Some of them. 
  Chandler:  You mean these tuxes have been down the red carpet with people
yelling, You are you wearing?! You look fabulous! 
  Rachel:  Honey, might I suggest watching a little more  ESPN  and a little
less  E! ? 
  Chandler:  Okay, who wore those? (Points to the tuxedos.) 
  Rachel:  Umm, well let&#146;s see uh, this one is Tom Brokaw. 
  Chandler:  Not bad. 
  Rachel:  (reading a tag) This one is uh Paul O&#146;Neil. 
  Chandler:  Who&#146;s that? 
  Rachel:  He plays for the Yankees. Seriously,  ESPN ! Just once and a while,
have it on in the background. (Chandler nods and Rachel grabs another tux) Ooh, this one
was Pierce Brosnan! 
  Chandler:  Pierce Brosnan? 
  Rachel:  Uh-huh. 
  Chandler:  Are you serious? 
  Rachel:  Yeah. 
  Chandler:  007?! This is James Bond&#146;s tux?! 
  Rachel:  Yeah. 
  Chandler:  Oh, I have to get married in James Bond&#146;s tux! 
  Rachel:  It&#146;s a pretty cool tux. 
  Chandler:  Oh, it&#146;s not just that, I would be England&#146;s most powerful
weapon. Jet setting heartbreaker on her majesty&#146;s secret service. A man who fears no
one; with a license to kill. (Worried.) Would Monica let me wear this? 
 [Scene: Joey and Rachel's, Joey and Phoebe are moving chess pieces around on the board
and hitting the timer at random.] 
  Joey:  We should really learn how to play the real way. (Moves another piece.) 
  Phoebe:  I like our way. Oh! (Grabs a piece and jumps a bunch of Joey&#146;s like
in Checkers.) Chess! 
  Joey:  Nice move. 
  Phoebe:  Yeah. 
  Rachel:  (entering) Hey! 
  Joey:  Hey! 
  Phoebe:  Hey! 
  Rachel:  So Joey I just hooked Ross and Chandler up with some tuxedos for the
wedding, do you need one? 
  Joey:  No, I&#146;m performing the ceremony. I&#146;m not wearing a tux. 
  Rachel:  Well, what are you going to wear? 
  Joey:  Multi-colored robes! Ooh, and maybe a hat. 
  Rachel:  Huh. Does Monica know about this? 
  Joey:  I don&#146;t think so. 
  Rachel:  Can I please be there when you tell her? (Joey nods yes.) 
  Phoebe:  Hey oh, Rach wait! Do you want to go to a movie tonight? 
  Rachel:  Oh, y&#146;know what? I can&#146;t. I have to have dinner with that
Melissa girl. 
  Joey:  (excitedly) Can I come?! I won&#146;t even talk! You&#146;ll just hear the
noise from my video camera. 
  Phoebe:  What is this? What&#146;s going on? 
  Joey:  Oh good! Can I tell her?! Can I tell her?! 
  Rachel:  Well, do you want to hear what actually happened or Joey&#146;s lewd
version? 
  Phoebe:  Joey&#146;s! 
  Joey:  Okay&#133; 
  Rachel:  Hey, come on! I had this friend from college and I made the stupid
mistake of telling Joey that one time&#133;she and I y&#146;know&#133;kissed a little bit. 
  Phoebe:  (laughs) Yeah, I&#146;m sure that happened. 
  Rachel:  It-it did! 
  Phoebe:  Sure! 
  Joey:  Hey. (Laughs then seriously) It happened! 
  Rachel:  Yeah, it was senior year in college. It was after the Sigma Chi luau and
Melissa and I got very drunk! And we ended up kissing! For several minutes!  
  Phoebe:  (To Joey) Which means she had a couple spritzers and a quick peck on the
cheek. 
  Joey:  Why are you taking this away from me? 
  Rachel:  Yeah, why is it so hard for you to believe?! 
  Phoebe:  Okay! I just&#151;I didn&#146;t know that you are a lesbian. (Joey
smiles and nods lewdly.) 
  Rachel:  I&#146;m not saying that I&#146;m a lesbian! I&#146;m just saying that
this happened! 
  Phoebe:  Okay, it just seems pretty wild and you&#146;re so&#151;y&#146;know
so&#133;vanilla. 
  Rachel:  (shocked) Vanilla?! 
  Phoebe:  Yeah. 
  Rachel:  I&#146;m not vanilla! I&#146;ve done lots of crazy things! I mean I
got-I got drunk and married in Vegas! 
  Phoebe:  To Ross. 
  Rachel:  All right, y&#146;know what? If you don&#146;t want to believe me about
this, why don&#146;t you just come with me to dinner tonight and she will tell you. 
  Phoebe:  Okay! All right! Yeah! &#145;Cause I just can&#146;t picture it. 
  Joey:  Oh-ho, you should get inside my head. 
 [Scene: Central Perk, Chandler is on the couch reading as Ross enters carrying a
garment bag.] 
  Ross:  Hey! Guess what I got for your wedding! (Holding up his garment bag.) 
  Chandler:  A freakish thin date with a hanger for her head? 
  Ross:  No. Rachel hooked me up with a tux! But not just any tux, Batman&#146;s
tux! 
  Chandler:  What? 
  Ross:  That&#146;s right! Made expressly for Val Kilmer and worn by him in the
hit film&#133;that Batman film he was in. 
  Chandler:  You can&#146;t wear that! I&#146;m wearing the famous tux! James
Bond&#146;s tux! 
  Ross:  So? 
  Chandler:  So&#151;If you wear that you&#146;ll make mine less special. 
  Ross:  Well, you need something to make this day special? Hello! You-you-you have
the most special thing of all!  You  are marrying the woman you love. 
 (Chandler mimics him.) 
  Chandler:  Please, don&#146;t take away my cool thing. Please?! Pretty please?! 
  Ross:  Pretty please? Not very uh, 007. 
  Chandler:  Look, it&#146;s my wedding day okay? If you were getting married I
would never do anything to upset you. 
  Ross:  When I got married you slept with my sister. 
  Chandler:   That  was pretty 007. 
 [Scene: Monica and Chandler's, Monica is still working on the seating chart as Joey
enters.] 
  Joey:  Hey. 
  Monica:  Hey. Oh good-good you&#146;re here! All right, I figured it out.
I&#146;m gonna take two tables of eight, I&#146;m gonna add your parents, and I&#146;m
gonna turn them into three tables of six. Okay? And I called the caterer; I added two
extra meals, we are good to go! 
  Joey:  Yeah, they&#146;re not coming. 
  Monica:  (looking at him) What?! 
  Joey:  Somehow they got the idea that you only invited them because of me.
They&#133;feel a little unwanted. 
  Monica:  Oh that&#146;s too bad. It&#146;s true, but too bad. 
  Joey:  Look Mon, if you could just call my mom&#133; 
  Monica:  Oh Joey! 
  Joey:  Come on! Look just-just tell&#151;let her know that you really want them
to be there. Let&#146;s not forget, this is a woman that has sent you many lasagnas over
the years. 
  Monica:  No she hasn&#146;t. 
  Joey:  Is it her fault that some of them didn&#146;t make it to you? 
  Monica:  Well, what am I going to say? 
  Joey:  I don&#146;t know. Just uh, just tell &#145;em it was a mix-up with the
invitations, or&#151;No-no-no! Blame it on the post office. They  hate  the post
office. And the Irish! But I don&#146;t think you can blame it on them so&#133; (He dials
the phone and hands it to Monica.) 
  Monica:  (on phone) Hello? (Listens) Yeah, hi! Mrs. Tribbiani? (Listens) Hi, this
is Monica Geller. (Listens) Yeah I&#146;m just calling to say that Chandler and I uh,
really hope you can make it to the wedding. Yeah, apparently a bunch of invitations that
we sent weren&#146;t delivered. Umm, I guess there was some screw up at the damn post
office! (Joey nods his approval.) (Listens) T-Tell me about it! (Listens) Yeah, yeah, the
US Post Office? No, more like US lost office! (Listens) What are they Irish?! (Joey gives
her a thumbs up.) 
 [Scene: A restaurant, Melissa, Rachel, and Phoebe are talking.] 
  Melissa:  &#133;anyway, his name is Allan and we&#146;ve been going out for three
years. He was my first client when I became a party planner. He was planning a party for
his girlfriend at the time. Oh well. (Rachel and Phoebe politely laugh) And he was Theta
Beta Pi at Syracuse. 
  Rachel:  Oh. Oh, that&#146;s great! 
  Melissa:  Hmm Phoebe, were you ever in a sorority? 
  Phoebe:  Of course! Yeah, I was uh, umm Thigh Mega Tampon. 
  Melissa:  What one? 
  Phoebe:  Yeah! Y&#146;know, we were really huge too, but then they had to shut us
down when Regina Philange died of alcohol poisoning. 
  Melissa:  Oh, isn&#146;t a shame when one girl ruins it for the whole bunch?
(Phoebe agrees by grunting.) 
  Rachel:  (changing the subject) Anyway, speaking of drinking too much. I was uh,
tellin&#146; Phoebe about that one crazy night after the Sigma Chi luau where you and I
uh, we made out. 
  Melissa:  (shocked) What? 
  Rachel:  Remember?! We&#151;come on both had the sarongs on, and we had the-the
coconut bikini tops&#133; 
  Melissa:  Yeah? 
  Rachel:  &#133;we went back the house and we got really silly and we&#133;we made
out. 
  Melissa:  Oh wow, Ray-ray I have no idea what you&#146;re talking about. 
  Phoebe:  Really?! 
  Commercial Break  
 [Scene: Monica and Chandler's, Monica is on the couch as Chandler disgustedly enters.] 
  Chandler:  Ross is Batman! 
  Monica:  Well, he did manage to keep his identity secret for a long time. 
  Chandler:  Rachel got Ross the tuxedo that Val Kilmer wore in Batman. Okay Batman
is so much cooler than James Bond! 
  Monica:  What are you talking about?! 007 has all those gadgets! 
  Chandler:  Batman has a utility belt! 
  Monica:  007 has a fancy car! 
  Chandler:  Batman has the Batmobile! 
  Monica:  007 gets all the ladies. 
  Chandler:  Batman has Robin! (Pause) We get  ESPN  right? 
  Monica:  How about you go put on your 007 tuxedo and I&#146;ll make you a nice
martini. 
  Chandler:  Actually, I don&#146;t like martinis. 
  Monica:  How about a  Youhoo  with a funny straw? 
  Chandler:  Ooh, yum! (Runs into the bedroom.) 
  Joey:  (entering) Hey. 
  Monica:  Hey. 
  Joey:  Listen, I know the invitation says 6:00, but does that mean that you want
people to get there at six, or the show is gonna start right at six? 
  Monica:  The show?! 
  Joey:  Right. Right. The wedding, gotcha. But I mean, it&#146;s gonna start a
little late right? I mean, weddings start late. Right? 
  Monica:  Have you ever been to one of  my  weddings? 
  Joey:  Ah. Yeah. Well look, the thing is it&#146;s the same day as my
niece&#146;s christening and I really want my parents to be there in time to see me.
&#145;Cause my part&#146;s just in the beginning I&#146;m not even in the rest of the
show&#151;Wedding! 
  Monica:  The wedding starts at six. 
  Joey:  Okay. Okay, I totally hear ya. Oo how about this? I vamp a little
&#145;til they get there? 
  Monica:  You&#146;ll vamp?! 
  Joey:  Yeah! Yeah y&#146;know, like warm up the crowd. Ask &#145;em where
they&#146;re from. &#145;Cause in Joey Tribbiani you get a minister  and  you get an
entertainer. I&#146;m a minis-tainer! (Rapping) There is no one better! There is no one
greater! 
 [Scene: The restaurant, continued from earlier.] 
  Rachel:  How can you not remember us kissing?! 
  Melissa:  I don&#146;t know. I don&#146;t remember a lot of things that never
happened. 
  Rachel:  Wh&#133; Come on! Remember? We were on the sleeping porch! We
couldn&#146;t stop giggling? And our coconuts kept knockin&#146; together? 
  Phoebe:  Oh, somewhere Joey&#146;s head is exploding. 
  Rachel:  Yeah&#151;but come on&#151;Listen, I&#146;m sorry I don&#146;t want to
make you uncomfortable, but I told Phoebe that it happened and she doesn&#146;t believe
me. 
  Melissa:  I&#146;m sorry Ray-ray. I mean if I thought it happened I would say it.
Maybe I passed out and you did stuff to me while I was sleeping. 
  Rachel:  No!! 
  Phoebe:  Rachel, it&#146;s okay. You don&#146;t have to do this. I believe you.
All right? Okay, if-if you say that you kissed Melissa, then you kissed Melissa. 
  Rachel:  Thank you Phoebe. 
  Melissa:  She didn&#146;t. 
  Phoebe:  I know. 
 [Scene: Monica and Chandler's, Monica and Chandler are working on the seating chart as
Ross enters carrying his tux around.] 
  Ross:  Hey! 
  Monica:  You just carry that around? 
  Ross:  Yes. I find it to be something of a conversation piece.  
  Monica:  Between you and&#133; 
  Ross:  Gunther. (To Chandler) Hey-hey! Why don&#146;t we put them on? Y&#146;know
get a picture of Batman and James Bond together. 
  Chandler:  I would but mine doesn&#146;t fit. The pants are a little tight. 
  Monica:  A little tight? I could see double-oh  and  seven in those pants. 
  Ross:  Well that stinks. I was looking forward to us wearing our celebrity tuxes
together. 
  Chandler:  Well, does that mean that you&#146;re not going to wearing yours? 
  Ross:  What are you kidding? It&#146;s Batman&#146;s tux!! 
  Chandler:  (standing up) Let me try it on! 
  Ross:  Okay, but just the jacket. Double-oh and seven are not gettin&#146; in
there. 
  Chandler:  (trying on the jacket) Okay. Holy double-vented comfort Batman! (Finds
something in the pocket) What&#146;s this? 
  Ross:  What? 
  Chandler:  An invitation for the  At First Sight  premiere? Oh my God! Val
Kilmer didn&#146;t wear this in Batman! He wore it to the premiere of some tooty-fruity
love story where he played a blind guy! 
  Ross:  Let me see that! (Grabs the invitation and reads it.) Oh man! 
  Chandler:  The only superpower you have is a slightly heightened sense of smell.
(Hands him the jacket and walks away.) 
  Joey:  (entering) Hey! Uh, Monica? Chandler? Can I talk to you guys for a second? 
  Monica:  All right that&#146;s it, I give up! Whatever you want you can have it!
You wanna sing a song? You wanna do a dance? You want your mom stand at the Alter and
scream racial slurs? I don&#146;t care! 
  Joey:  No! No, I-I just wanna thank you guys for what you did for my parents,
that was really sweet. They&#146;re so happy they get to be a part of your special day. 
  Monica:  (defeated) Oh. 
  Chandler:  Well, you&#146;re welcome. And tell them we&#146;re really glad
they&#146;re coming. 
  Joey:  Okay. I will. Ohh! Check out what they got me to wear for the ceremony!
(Runs to his apartment and returns wearing a rather silly hat.) Huh? I wear it like this
when I marry you guys, and then this (He tilts it to the side of his head) is for party
time. 
 [Scene: Outside the restaurant, Melissa, Phoebe, and Rachel are emerging.] 
  Rachel:  It happened! I am telling you it happened! 
  Melissa:  Okay. (To Phoebe) Well, it was great meeting you. And uh Rachel, I-I
don&#146;t think I&#146;ll be calling you (hails a cab) because umm, y&#146;know
you&#146;ve gotten weird. (The cab pulls up.) Take care you guys. 
 (She&#146;s about to get in when&#133;) 
  Rachel:  What?! Wait a minute! No wait a minute! (She does so.) Okay? Look,  that 
night was the one wild thing I have ever done in my entire life, and I&#146;m  not 
gonna let you take that away from me! Okay, so if you don&#146;t remember that,  maybe 
you will remember this! (She grabs Melissa and kisses her on the lips.) 
  Melissa:  My God! You love me! 
  Rachel:  (shocked) What? 
  Melissa:  Of course I remember our kiss. I think about it all the time. I can
still hear the coconuts knockin&#146; together I&#133; (Phoebe is shocked.) I just
didn&#146;t want to tell you &#145;cause I didn&#146;t think that you&#146;d return my
love, and now that you have&#133; (Leans in to kiss Rachel.) 
  Rachel:  (moving away) Whoa! Whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa! Whoa! Whoa! 
  Melissa:  Aww, look who&#146;s being suddenly shy. You can&#146;t tell me you
don&#146;t feel what I feel. Nobody can kiss that good and not mean it. (Goes in again.) 
  Rachel:  (moves away again) I-I-I-I&#146;m just&#133;I&#146;m just a good kisser! 
  Melissa:  (suddenly frightened) Shut up! 
  Rachel:  I&#146;m sorry! 
  Melissa:  (laughs) Oh you don&#146;t have to be (Laughs again) sorry.
I&#146;m&#133;I&#146;m obviously kidding. I&#146;m not in love with you. (To Phoebe)
I&#146;m not in love with her. I don&#146;t hear coconuts banging together. Yeah, I
don&#146;t&#133;picture your face when I make love to my boyfriend. Anyway, I gotta go.
Eh&#133;kiss good-bye? (Rachel stares at her stunned.) No? Okay. (Hurries into the cab and
drives off.) 
  Rachel:  Wow! I mean I had no idea that that was gonna&#133; 
 (Suddenly, Phoebe leans in and kisses her on the lips!) 
  Rachel:  What the hell was that?! 
  Phoebe:  I just wanted to see what all the fuss was about. 
  Rachel:  And? 
  Phoebe:  I&#146;ve had better. 
  Ending Credits  
 [Scene:  Ralph Lauren , Rachel is hooking Chandler up with another tuxedo.] 
  Chandler:  (yelling from the changing room) All right! I found one that fits! 
  Rachel:  Well y&#146;know what they say, the 23 rd  time&#146;s the
