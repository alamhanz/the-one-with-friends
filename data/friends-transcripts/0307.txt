 [Scene: Central Perk, the whole gang is there, Ross is telling a story about what
happened at work and the rest of the gang are thinking to themselves, denoted by italics.] 
  Ross:  So I told Carl, &#145;Nobody, no matter how famous their parents are,
nobody is allowed to climb on the dinosaur.&#146; But of course this went in one ear and
out..... 
  Rachel:   I love how he cares so much about stuff. If I squint I can pretend
he&#146;s Alan Alda.  
  Monica:   Oh good, another dinosaur story. When are those gonna become extinct?  
  Chandler:   If I was a superhero who could fly  and  be invisible, that
would be the best.  
  Gunther:   What does Rachel see in this guy? I love Rachel. I wish she was my
wife.  
 (Joey is singing in his head.) 
  Phoebe:   Who&#146;s singing?  
 
  Opening Credits  
 
 [Scene: Monica and Rachel's, the whole gang is there including Janice, they&#146;re
watching  Happy Days .] 
  Ross:  Hey. When you guys were kids and you played  Happy Days , who were
you? I was always Richie. 
  Monica:  I was always Joanne. 
  Joey:  Question. Was ah, &#145;Egg the Gellers!&#146; the war cry of your
neighbourhood? 
 (A commercial for the Mattress King, Janice&#146;s ex-husband, comes on TV.) 
  Phoebe:  Ewww! Oh! It&#146;s the Mattress King! 
  Joey:  Booo!! 
  Chandler:  (to Janice) Don&#146;t look honey. Change the channel! Change the
channel! 
  Janice:  Wait! Wait! I wanna see this. After I divorce him, half of that kingdom
is gonna be mine. 
  Matress King:  (on TV)  &#145;Despair fills the mattress showroom. My kingdom
is suddenly without a queen. I&#146;m so depressed I&#146;m going to slash... my prices!!
Check it out! Four ninety-nine for a pillow top queen set! I&#146;m going medieval on
prices!  
  Chandler:  What a wank! 
  Janice:  Oh, I cannot believe he&#146;s using our divorce to sell mattresses. 
  Monica:  I know! And four ninety-nine for a pillow top queen set, who cares about
the divorce, those babies will sell themselves. (they all stare at her) And I&#146;m
appalled for you by the way. 
  Matress King:  (on TV)  I&#146;m close. I&#146;m cheap. I&#146;m the king.  
 [Scene: Central Perk, Rachel is on the phone, everyone else is there except Joey.] 
  Rachel:  &#145;Okay. (listens) Okay, daddy we&#146;ll see you tomorrow night.
(listens) Okay bye-bye.&#146; (hangs up) 
  Ross:  We? 
  Rachel:  Are ah, having dinner with my Dad tomorrow night, I hope that&#146;s
okay. 
  Ross:  Oh shoot, tomorrow&#146;s not so good, I&#146;m supposed to um, fall off
the Empire State building and land on a bicycle with no seat. Sorry. 
  Rachel:  Ross, my father doesn&#146;t hate you. 
  Ross:  Please, he refers to me as &#145;wethead&#146;. 
  Rachel:  But honey he calls everybody by a nickname! Okay, look, I know, all
right, just one dinner, please, just one night for me, please. I just want him to love you
like I do. (Ross looks at her) All right, well not exactly like I do, but, but, if you do
come to dinner, I&#146;ll love you like I do in that black thing that you like. 
  Chandler:  (leaning in) I&#146;ll go. 
  Ross:  Fine. 
  Rachel:  Thank you. 
  Ross:  Hi Gunther. 
  Gunther:  Yeah, we&#146;ll see! 
  Joey:  (entering) Hey, you guys! 
  Phoebe:  Hey! 
  Joey:  Guess what? 
  Ross:  What? 
  Joey:  I got a gig! 
  All:  Yay!! 
  Chandler:  See, that&#146;s why I could never be an actor. Because I can&#146;t
say gig. 
  Phoebe:  Yeah, I can&#146;t say croissant. (realises) Oh my God! 
  Monica:  What&#146;s the part? 
  Joey:  Well, it&#146;s not a part, no. I&#146;m teaching acting for soap operas
down at the Learning Extension. 
  Ross:  Come on! That&#146;s great. 
  All:  Wow! 
  Joey:  Yeah, yeah. It&#146;s like my chance to give something back to the acting
community. 
  Ross:  Y&#146;know your probably not allowed to sleep with any of your students. 
  Joey:  (glares at him) I know! 
 [Scene: Mattress King, Monica and Phoebe are shopping for a new mattress.] 
  Phoebe:  Ugh! I don&#146;t know Monica. It feels funny just being here. I mean if
you buy a bed from Janice&#146;s ex-husband, that&#146;s like betraying Chandler. 
  Monica:  Not at these prices. 
  Phoebe:  (sees a little kid playing with a race car bed) (to kid) Hi. Y'know in
England this car would be on the other side of the store. (the kid just stares at her, and
she makes the &#145;that went right over your head&#146; motion) Woo! 
  Monica:  (lying down on a mattress) Oh! Ohhhhh! Oh! Phoebe, come here. Aw, this
is my new bed. You gotta feel this bad boy. 
  Phoebe:  Eh, Monica it, it feels so weird, y'know, Chandler&#146;s your friend...
(hops onto the bed) Oh! Oh my God! Aw, all right take this bed, you can make other
friends. 
 [Scene: Classroom. Joey is writing his name on the board, but turns around before
he&#146;s done which causes him to write his name with a downward curve, and he then
underlines it, and draws the line right through his name.] 
  Joey:  Good evening. I&#146;m Mr. Tribbiani. And I will be teaching acting for
soap operas. Now um, on my first day as (proudly) Dr. Drake Remoray on  Days of Our
Lives , (looks for a reaction from his students, and gets none.) I learned that one of
the most important things in soap opera acting is reacting, this does not mean acting
again, it means, you don&#146;t have a line, but someone else just did. And it goes like
this. (looks all intense for a moment and then gasps, the students cheer him) Thanks,
thanks, a lot. Oh, by the way, before I forget to work in soap operas some of you will
have to become much more attractive. All right, moving right along. 
 [Scene: Monica and Rachel's, Joey is entering, Phoebe is already there waiting for the
delievery guy.] 
  Joey:  Hi! 
  Phoebe:  Hey! Ooh! How was teaching last night? 
  Joey:  Oh it was great. Yeah, you get to say stuff like, &#146;Hey, the bell
doesn&#146;t dismiss you,  I  dismiss you.&#146; 
  Phoebe:  Ooooh, nice. 
  Joey:  Oh, and guess what, I got an audition for  All My Children . 
  Phoebe:  Oh, yay! 
  Joey:  Yeah, it&#146;s this great part, this boxer named Nick. And I&#146;m so,
so right for it, y'know, he&#146;s just like me. Except he&#146;s a boxer, and has an evil
twin. 
 (There is a knock on the door.) 
  Phoebe:  Oh. (goes and answers the door and there is this  huge  black
delievery guy.)  
  Guy:  Dom da-da dom! Here ye! Here ye! Delivery from the Mattress King. (to
Phoebe) You Miss Geller? 
  Phoebe:  Okay. 
  Guy:  Sign here. (hands her a clipboard) 
  Phoebe:  Oh, do I have a middle name. All right Monica Velula Geller. It&#146;s
that bedroom there. (points to Monica&#146;s room) 
  Joey:  Hey, Monica bought a bed from the Mattress King? 
  Phoebe:  Yeah, so please, please, please, don&#146;t say anything to Chandler. 
  Joey:  You want me to lie to Chandler? 
  Phoebe:  Is that a problem? 
  Joey:  No. 
  Phoebe:  Oh, hey, hey Nick the boxer let&#146;s see what you got. All right ya,
put &#145;em up. Come on. (they start shadow boxing) 
  Joey:  Hey, you&#146;re ah, pretty good at this. 
  Phoebe:  Yeah, well I had to learn, I was staying at the Y and some off the young
men weren&#146;t acting Christian enough. 
  Joey:  Ahh! 
 (Joey throws a punch and just lightly taps her on the shoulder, Phoebe counters with a
jab to the nose.) 
  Joey:  Hey now! 
 (Phoebe throws another jab, and lands it on Joey&#146;s nose, causing it to bleed.) 
  Joey:  Hey!!! Oww!! And I&#146;m bleeding. 
  Phoebe:  Oh! Oh! Oh! 
  Joey:  Okay, great. 
  Phoebe:  Wow! And I&#146;m a vegetarian! All right, all right, well I&#146;m
sorry, we&#146;ll put some ice on it.  
  Joey:  Okay. 
  Phoebe:  &#145;Kay, put your head back. 
  Joey:  All right. I can&#146;t see. 
  Phoebe:  All right, I have ya. Oh God. 
  Guy:  Which bedroom do ya want it in Miss Geller? 
  Phoebe:  Oh, it&#146;s the compulsively neat one by the window, okay. 
  Guy:  Gotcha. (he and his helper walk in carrying the racecar bed.) 
 [Scene: Restaurant, Rachel and Ross and Dr. Green are having dinner.] 
  Rachel:  Hi Daddy! 
  Dr. Green:  This where they put it? What, there no table available in the
kitchen! Hello, baby. 
  Rachel:  You remember Ross. 
  Dr. Green:  Um-hmm. 
  Ross:  Nice to see you again Dr. Green.  
  Dr. Green:  So! (they both try to sit next to Rachel but Dr. Green is
successful.) (to Ross) How&#146;s the library? 
  Ross:  Ugh, museum. 
  Dr. Green:  What happened to the library? 
  Ross:  There never was a library. I mean there are libraries, its just that I ah,
I never worked at one. 
  Dr. Green:  You know what&#146;s really good here, the lobster. What do you say
shall I just order three. 
  Ross:  Yeah, if you&#146;re really hungry. (Dr. Green stares at him) It was a
joke, I made a joke. 
  Rachel:  Yeah, actually Daddy Ross is allergic to lobster. 
  Dr. Green:  What kind of person is allergic to lobster? I guess the kind of
person that works at a library. 
  Ross:  It&#146;s not a library... 
  Dr. Green:  (interrupting him) I know!! It&#146;s a museum! What, you&#146;re the
only one around here who can make a joke! At least mine was funny. Ah, waiter, we will
have two lobsters and a menu. (nods at Ross, and mouths I don&#146;t know to the waiter.) 
 [Scene: After dinner.] 
  Ross:  So, Dr. Green, how&#146;s the old boat. 
  Dr. Green:  They found rust. You know what rust does to a boat? 
  Ross:  It gives it a nice antiquey look. 
  Dr. Green:  (he stares at Ross) Rust, is boat cancer, Ross. 
  Ross:  Wow. I&#146;m sorry, when I was a kid I lost a bike to that. (Rachel
giggles at that) 
  Dr. Green:  Excuse me for a moment, will you please, I want to say good night to
the Levines, before we go. 
  Rachel:  Okay. 
  Ross:  Okay! (picks up a knife and pretends to stab his heart.) 
  Rachel:  Aw honey stop! It&#146;s not that bad. 
  Ross:  Yeah. (sees the bill) Op! Uh-oh! I think your Dad must&#146;ve added
wrong. He only tipped like four percent. 
  Rachel:  Yeah. That&#146;s Daddy. 
  Ross:  That&#146;s Daddy?! But doesn&#146;t it bother you? You&#146;re a
waitress. 
  Rachel:  Yes, it bothers me Ross, but y'know if he was a regular at the coffee
house, I&#146;d be serving him sneezers. 
  Ross:  So? 
  Rachel:  So. Ross, I&#146;ve bugged him about this a million times, he&#146;s not
gonna change. 
  Ross:  You really serve people sneezers? 
  Rachel:  Well um,  I  don&#146;t. 
  Dr Green:  You kids ready? 
  Ross:  Thanks again, Dr. Green. 
  Dr. Green:  All right. 
 (Ross takes a twenty and slips it underneath the bill when Dr. Green isn&#146;t
looking.) 
  Dr. Green:  Oh, wait, wait, wait, wait, I think I forgot my receipt. 
  Ross:  Oh, ah, you don&#146;t need that. 
  Dr. Green:  Why not? 
  Ross:  The carbon, it&#146;s messy, I mean it gets on your fingers and causes,
the, the ah, night blindness. 
  Dr. Green:  (gets his receipt and notices the twenty) What is this? Who put a
twenty down here? Huh? 
  Ross:  Oh, yeah, that would be me, um, I have, I have a problem I-I tip way too
much, way, way, too much, it&#146;s a sickness really. 
  Rachel:  Yeah it is, it is. (to Ross) We really, really have to do something
about that. 
  Ross:  I know. 
  Dr. Green:  Excuse me, you think I&#146;m cheap? 
  Rachel:  Oh Daddy, no he didn&#146;t mean anything by that, he really
didn&#146;t. 
  Ross:  Nothing I do means anything, really. 
  Dr. Green:  This is nice. I pay two hundred dollars for dinner, you put down
twenty, and you come out looking like Mr. Big Shot. You really want to be Mr. Big Shot?
Here, I&#146;ll tell you what, you pay the whole bill, Mr. Big Shot, all right. (rips up
the bill, and throws it at Ross, then leaves) 
  Ross:  Well Mr. Big Shot is better than &#145;wethead&#146;. 
 [Scene: Classroom, Joey is lecturing on facial expressions.] 
  Joey:  Okay, some tricks of the trade. Now, I&#146;ve never been able to cry as
an actor, so if I&#146;m in a scene where I have to cry, I cut a hole in my pocket, take a
pair of tweezers, and just start pulling. Or ah, or, let&#146;s say I wanna convey that
I&#146;ve just done something evil. That would be the basic &#145;I have a fishhook in my
eyebrow and I like it&#146; (Does it by raising one eyebrow, and showing off the pretend
fishhook.) Okay, let&#146;s say I&#146;ve just gotten bad news, well all I do there is try
and divide 232 by 13. (looks all confused) And that&#146;s how it&#146;s done. Great soap
opera acting tonight everybody, class dismissed. 
  Student:  Hey, Mr. Trib. 
  Joey:  Hey-hey. 
  Student:  Guess what, I got an audition! 
  Joey:  Awww, one of my students got an audition. I&#146;m so proud. 
  Student:  I was wondering if you would consider coaching me for it? 
  Joey:  You bet! What&#146;s the part? 
  Student:  Oh it&#146;s great, it&#146;s a role on  All My Children , Nick
the boxer. 
 (Joey does the &#145;232 divided by 13 bad news&#146; look.) 
  Commercial Break  
 [Scene: Hallway, Ross and Rachel are returning from dinner.] 
  Rachel:  You had to do it, didn&#146;t you? You couldn&#146;t just leave it
alone. 
  Ross:  Four percent. Okay. I tip more than that when there&#146;s a bug in my
food. 
  Rachel:  Ross, tonight was about the two of you getting along. (Ross groans and
rubs his neck) Oh, would you just see my chiropractor, already. 
  Ross:  Yeah, I&#146;m gonna go to a doctor who went to school in a mini-mall. 
 (they go into Monica and Rachel&#146;s, and see Phoebe hopping around.) 
  Ross:  Hey Pheebs, what are you doing? 
  Phoebe:  I&#146;m, I&#146;m freaking out! Monica kinda trusted me with something
and she shouldn&#146;t have! All right, I haven&#146;t lived here in a while, so I have to
ask you something. Does Monica still turn on the lights in her bedroom? 
  Rachel:  Um. yeah. 
  Phoebe:  I am  soo  dead. (goes to Monica&#146;s room) 
  Rachel:  All right, look, here&#146;s the bottom line Ross, this is fixable, if
we act fast, okay. So, I&#146;ll invite him to brunch tomorrow and you can make nice. 
  Ross:  Look, honey, I have tried to make nice, it doesn&#146;t work. 
  Rachel:  Okay, look, Ross, I realise that my Father is difficult, but that&#146;s
why you have got to be the bigger man here. 
  Ross:  Look sweetie, I could be the bigger man, I could be the biggest man, I
could be a big, huge, giant man, and it still wouldn&#146;t make any difference, except
that I could pick your Father up and say &#145;Like me! Like me tiny doctor!&#146; 
  Rachel:  Okay, well can&#146;t you just try it one more time Ross? For me? For
me? 
  Ross:  Rachel one brunch is not gonna solve anything. You gotta face it, okay
we&#146;re never gonna get along. 
  Rachel:  Okay, well you are just gonna have too, okay. Because I already got a
Mother and a Father who cannot stay in the same room together, okay, I don&#146;t wanna
have to have a separate room for you too!! (starts to cry) 
  Ross:  Okay, okay, okay. (hugs her) I&#146;ll get the bagels. 
 [Scene: Monica&#146;s bedroom, Phoebe is trying to hide the bed from Monica.] 
  Monica:  (sees the bed) What&#146;s this? 
  Phoebe:  Isn&#146;t it cool! Varoom! Varoom! 
  Monica:  This is not the bed I ordered! 
  Phoebe:  I know, you must&#146;ve won like a contest or something!  
 (Phoebe starts to make a sound like a car accelerating) 
  Monica:  Phoebe! 
 (Phoebe makes a sound like a car screeching to a halt.) 
  Monica:  Why is this car in my bedroom? 
  Phoebe:  I&#146;m sorry, okay, I-I wasn&#146;t looking, and the store says that
they won&#146;t take it back because you signed for it... 
  Monica:  When did I sign for it? 
  Phoebe:  When I was you! Y'know what, it&#146;s all Joey&#146;s fault,
&#145;cause he left his nose open! 
  Monica:  Did you make brownies today? 
  Chandler:  Knock, knock. 
  Monica:  (to Phoebe) Quick, take off your dress, he won&#146;t notice the bed. 
  Chandler:  Hey, I&#146;m going for sushi does anybody want.. (enters and sees the
bed) Whoa-whoa, somebody missed the off ramp. 
  Phoebe:  It&#146;s Monica&#146;s bed. What? 
  Chandler:  Okay. (to Monica) It&#146;s a racecar. 
  Phoebe:  So. This has always been Monica&#146;s bed, what you&#146;re just
noticing now, how self-involved are you? 
  Chandler:  Okay, well it this bed isn&#146;t new, how come there is plastic on
the mattress? 
  Monica:  Sometimes I have bad dreams. (starts to break down, and Phoebe offers
her, her hand to comfort her.) 
 [Scene: Classroom, Joey is coaching his student.] 
  Student:  Look, I just saw my best friends brains smeared across the canvas,
that&#146;s not gonna be me, not me. 
  Joey:  Wow! That was good. That was...(points to his pocket) Tweezers? 
  Student:  No. 
  Joey:  Whoa. That was really good. 
  Student:  Thanks, any suggestions? 
 (Joey gets the evil look on his face.) 
 [Scene: Central Perk, Chandler, Monica, and Phoebe are there, yelling at Joey.] 
  Chandler:  You told him to play the boxer gay!! 
  Joey:  Well, I-I might&#146;ve said supergay. 
  Chandler:  You totally screwed him over. 
  Monica:  Joey, you&#146;re this guy&#146;s teacher. I mean how could you do this? 
  Joey:  Because, Monica, the guy&#146;s so good, and I really, really want this
part. 
  Phoebe:  Well, if you really, really want it, then it&#146;s okay. 
 [Scene: Monica and Rachel's, Rachel is greeting her Father for their brunch.] 
  Rachel:  (opening the door) Hi Daddy. 
  Dr. Green:  Baby. Ross. 
  Ross:  Dr. Green. How are you? (offers his hand, and Dr. Green puts his scarf on
it.) 
  Dr. Green:  Thanks for dinner last night. 
  Ross:  Thank you for teaching me a valuable lesson. 
  Dr. Green:  Nice hair. What&#146;d ya do? Swim here? 
  Ross:  (to Rachel) Okay, that&#146;s it, I can&#146;t take it anymore. 
  Rachel:  What? What? He&#146;s interested in you. He-he likes your hair, he just
wants to know how you got here. 
  Ross:  Oh, please. Sweetie it&#146;s hopeless, okay, I&#146;m just gonna go.
(starts to leave rubbing his neck) 
  Rachel:  What?! 
  Ross:  Look, look I&#146;m sorry. It&#146;s just that.... 
  Dr. Green:  Ross? What&#146;s with the neck? 
  Rachel:  He&#146;s got this thing. And I keep telling him to go to my
chiropractor... 
  Dr. Green:  You&#146;re still going to that chiropractor, that man couldn&#146;t
get into medical school in Extapa! 
  Ross:  Thank you! That&#146;s what I keep saying. 
  Rachel:  Excuse me, Dr. Bobby happens to be an excellent doctor. 
  Ross:  Uh. 
  Dr. Green:  Wait a minute, his name is Dr. Bobby? 
  Rachel:  Well that&#146;s his last name. 
  Ross:  And his first name. 
  Dr. Green:  He&#146;s Bobby Bobby? 
  Rachel:  It&#146;s Robert Bobby. 
  Dr. Green:  Oh. 
  Rachel:  And um, excuse me, he helps me. 
  Ross:  Oh-ho please. Ask her how? 
  Dr. Green:  What do you need help for? 
  Rachel:  With my alignment. I&#146;ve got one leg shorter than the other. 
  Dr. Green:  Oh God! 
  Ross:  Argue with that. 
  Rachel:  What? It&#146;s true, my right leg is two inches shorter. 
  Dr. Green:  Come on! You&#146;re just titling! (to Ross) Her legs are fine! 
  Ross:  I know that! 
  Dr. Green:  So, why do you let her go to a chiropractor for? 
  Rachel:  I&#146;m sorry, let her? 
  Ross:  What can I do, she doesn&#146;t listen to me about renter&#146;s insurance
either. 
  Dr. Green:  Wait a minute, you don&#146;t have renter&#146;s insurance?! 
  Rachel:  No. 
  Dr. Green:  Well what if somebody steals something? How are you gonna run after
him with one leg shorter than the other?! 
 (Both he and Ross start laughing) 
  Ross:  Hey, would you ah, would you like some juice? 
  Dr. Green:  I&#146;d love some juice. Thanks. 
  Ross:  Okay. (to Rachel) Wow! This is going so well. Did you see us? Did you see? 
  Rachel:  Yeah honey, I&#146;m standing right there! Why didn&#146;t you just tell
him about the mole I haven&#146;t got checked yet. 
  Ross:  Excellent! 
 [Scene: Classroom, Joey is talking to his students.] 
  Joey:  (sadly) There will come a time in each of your careers when you&#146;ll
have a chance to screw over another soap opera actor. I had such an opportunity in the
recent, present. And I&#146;m ashamed to say that I took it, I advised a fellow actor to
play a role, homosexually. Yeah, we both auditioned for the part, and uh, as it turned
out, they ah, they liked the stupid gay thing and cast him. And now, he&#146;s got a two
year contract opposite Susan Luchhi, the first lady of daytime television, and me, me
I&#146;m stuck here teaching a bunch of people, most of whom are too ugly to even be on
TV. I&#146;m sorry, I&#146;m sorry, I&#146;m sorry. (he gets a huge round of applause from
his students.) Thank you. 
 [Scene: Mattress King, Monica is trying to return her bed.] 
  Jester:  Uh, may I help you? 
  Monica:  Yeah, I talked to you on the phone, I&#146;m the lady that got stuck
with the racecar bed. 
  Jester:  Look, it&#146;s like I told you, there&#146;s nothing I can do. You
signed for it, Monica Velula Geller. 
  Joey:  All right, Jester man, look we wanna see the king. 
  Jester:  Nobody sees the king! 
  Joey:  Oh-ho-kay, I&#146;m talking to the king. (starts to go to a back room) 
  Jester:  Hey! You can&#146;t go back there! 
 (Joey goes to the door, but stops and looks through the window at Janice and the
Mattress King, her ex-husband, kissing.) 
  Janice:  Oh my God. 
 (Joey fakes a scream.) 
  Closing Credits  
 [Scene: Monica&#146;s bedroom, Chandler is playing with the bed.] 
  Chandler:  Varrrrrroom! Hey! Watch it lady! Varrrrrrrrrrom! (makes a screeching
sound as he pretends to stomp on the brakes.) Hey-hey good lookin&#146;! (honks the
bed&#146;s little horn on the steering wheel.) Varrrrrrrrroom. (notices Rachel and stops)
All right, I&#146;ll leave. My bed&#146;s so boring. 
 
   End
