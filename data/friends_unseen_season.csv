what,2,0901,09,40529
oh it's a secret oh goodie yes we haven't done the secret thing in a long time,6,0901,09,40530
phoebe there is no secret okay i didn't propose,2,0901,09,40531
are you lying is this like that time you tried to convince us that you were a doctor,6,0901,09,40532

and so engaged,6,0901,09,40536
what oh my god she she thinks we're engaged why why why would she think we're engaged,2,0901,09,40537
perhaps because you gave her an engagement ring y'know ross doctors are supposed to be smart,6,0901,09,40538
i didn't give her that ring,2,0901,09,40539
no,2,0901,09,40540
so whose ring is it,6,0901,09,40541
it's mine,2,0901,09,40542
is it an engagement ring,6,0901,09,40543
but you didn't give it to her,6,0901,09,40544
no,2,0901,09,40545
but you were going to propose,6,0901,09,40546
no,2,0901,09,40547
huh i might be losing interest in this,6,0901,09,40548
look look my mom gave me that ring because she wanted me to propose to rachel but all i wanted to do is if she maybe kinda wanted ah start things up again,2,0901,09,40549
oh what beautiful lukewarm sentiment,6,0901,09,40550
no no she said you actually proposed to her,6,0901,09,40551
well i didn't i didn't propose unless uh did i i haven't slept in forty hours and it does sound like something i would do commercial break,2,0901,09,40552
look we can't stay in here forever,4,0901,09,40553
oh i still can't believe my dad saw us having sex he didn't make it to one of piano recitals but this he sees,3,0901,09,40554
this is okay we're all adults here; there's nothing to be ashamed of now let's put our underwear in our pockets and walk out the door,4,0901,09,40555
hi dad i can still call you that right,3,0901,09,40556
of course i'll always be your dad,0,0901,09,40557
i just want you to know that what you witnessed in there that wasn't for fun,4,0901,09,40558
it wasn't fun,3,0901,09,40559
why why why would you wh why look i just don't want you to think that we're animals who do it whenever we want,4,0901,09,40560
oh i don't think that before today i never thought of you two having sex at all it was a simpler time,0,0901,09,40561
the truth is dad we're we're trying,3,0901,09,40562
what,0,0901,09,40563
yeah we're trying to get pregnant,3,0901,09,40564
oh my god this is so exciting well get back in there i'll guard the door,0,0901,09,40565
well that's okay dad we we can wait until later,3,0901,09,40566
whoa whoa whoa i don't think so aren't you ovulating,0,0901,09,40567
daddy,3,0901,09,40568
well you gotta get at it princess when your mother and i were trying to conceive you whenever she was ovulating bam we did it that's how i got my bad hip,0,0901,09,40569
that's funny this conversation's how i got the bullet hole in my head,4,0901,09,40570
this one time i had my knee up on the sink and your mother she was,0,0901,09,40571
daddy i don't think we need to hear about the specific positions you and mom had sex,3,0901,09,40572
you're right you're right this is about your positions now what i saw in the closet is not the optimum position for conceiving a child although it might feel good,0,0901,09,40573
i don't feel good right now,3,0901,09,40574
but pleasure is important and it helps if the woman has an orgasm you up to the task sailor,0,0901,09,40575
seriously sir my brains all over the wall,4,0901,09,40576
hey i need to tell you something,1,0901,09,40577

why did i have to say mike i don't know a mike why couldn't i have said there's no guy in there,5,0903,09,40960
it's impossible to find a good doctor i mean how do you know the good ones from the ones who are gonna push their penis against your knee,1,0903,09,40961
excuse me,3,0903,09,40962
i know what she's talking about,4,0903,09,40963
we've got to find a new pediatrician ross was getting sick last night and i think emma may have caught it,1,0903,09,40964
why don't you go see dr gettleman,3,0903,09,40965
ross said he died,1,0903,09,40966
he didn't die i saw his daughter last week said he was fine her on the other hand botched botox,3,0903,09,40967
oh great well then i'm gonna take emma to see him i wonder why ross said that he died,1,0903,09,40968
oh maybe he was getting him confused with his childhood therapist,3,0903,09,40969
he saw a therapist,4,0903,09,40970
yeah he used to have this recurring nightmare just really freaked him out,3,0903,09,40971
why what was it,1,0903,09,40972
that i was going to eat him,3,0903,09,40973
mike,5,0903,09,40974
i gotta tell you i can't believe i'm doing this with you although i did just get out of a nine year relationship so i guess i should be open and taking some risks,0,0903,09,40975
everything is gonna be fine just follow my lead okay all you have to do is pretend to be mike,5,0903,09,40976
i am mike,0,0903,09,40977
atta boy,5,0903,09,40978
joey this is mary ellen jenkins so mike how do you and joey know each other anyway,6,0903,09,40979

what that's the kinda thing you usually run by me,5,0903,09,40986
i always wanted to play piano professionally and i figured if i don't do this now i never will,0,0903,09,40987
wow that's great i liked that better than the law thing so,6,0903,09,40988
which is why i waited until now to introduce you to mike,5,0903,09,40989

'slim pickings' that is so cheesy,3,0903,09,40997
'so cheesy' also has an opening,4,0903,09,40998

so nancy told me about this job at this great restaurant javo it's just a little outside of tulsa,3,0903,09,41034
how far outside,4,0903,09,41035
manhattan,3,0903,09,41036
and you're thinking of taking it so before you said being me with me was more important than any job but i guess now it's old job me new job,4,0903,09,41037
i'm gonna miss this hand okay i know it's a lot to ask but oh my god chandler this is a once in a lifetime opportunity,3,0903,09,41038
what happened to 'you can't live without me four days a week',4,0903,09,41039
i think you should take the job,4,0903,09,41040
yeah i know it must be important to you when you start chattering like a monkey,4,0903,09,41041
that's the nicest anyone has ever said to me,3,0903,09,41042
how was the pediatrician,3,0903,09,41043
oh i really liked him yeah it was really really really good,1,0903,09,41044
you promised you wouldn't say anything,2,0903,09,41045
i know ross still sees his pediatrician i don't care,1,0903,09,41046
are you serious you still see dr gettleman,3,0903,09,41047
he's a brilliant diagnostician,2,0903,09,41048
diagnostician or boo boo fixer,4,0903,09,41049
ross seriously you've gotta go to an appropriate doctor,1,0903,09,41050
why why i know it's a little weird but hey he's a great doctor okay he knows my medical history and every time i go in there he makes a big deal 'ah look it's my favorite patient ',2,0903,09,41051
does he say that before he sticks his thermometer in your touchy,4,0903,09,41052
hey i seem to remember someone bringing his security blanket to college,2,0903,09,41053
that was not a security blanket that was a wall hanging,4,0903,09,41054
it didn't spend much time on the wall,2,0903,09,41055
excuse me hi i was hoping i would run into you can we talk,0,0903,09,41056
i'm sorry really i'm so embarrassed really i'm a pretty nice guy just ask my parole officer apparently i'm not a funny guy,0,0903,09,41057
why did you go along with that,6,0903,09,41058
because i was told i'd get a free dinner which i didn't and that i'd meet a pretty girl which i did,0,0903,09,41059
that's true well is anything you told me about yourself true,6,0903,09,41060

uhuh yeah you know and given my life long search for irony you can imagine how happy i am,6,0906,09,41545
what are you gonna do,3,0906,09,41546
i mean i guess i just have to tell david that nothing can happen between us unless i don't you know complicated moral situation no right no wrong,6,0906,09,41547
you have to tell david,3,0906,09,41548
okay i knew i should have had this conversation with joey,6,0906,09,41549
funniest guy she's ever met i'm funny right what do you know you're a door you just like knock knock jokes save it for inside,4,0906,09,41550
heeeeeey,3,0906,09,41551
was your cabin pressurised,3,0906,09,41552
and don't get me started on the way that people from tulsa talk,4,0906,09,41553
no it just remind me of something this guy did today at work i told you about that funny guy geoffrey right,3,0906,09,41554

were you there,4,0906,09,41556
no but it sounds like it was fricken funny,6,0906,09,41557
i really do understand how hard it's gotta be to leave your child with another person i mean it's leaving behind a piece of your heart,0,0906,09,41558
sandy that's exactly what it is,1,0906,09,41559
are you gay,2,0906,09,41560

her name is deliah,0,0906,09,41563
so you're just like a guy who's a nanny,2,0906,09,41564
i realise how it's a bit unorthodox for some people but i really believe the most satisfying thing you can do with your life is take care of a child,0,0906,09,41565

just for a few seconds so i can know what it is please,4,0907,09,41863
all right fine but if i enjoy this you have only yourself to blame,5,0907,09,41864
why am i hearing cheering,4,0907,09,41865
well it's okay its like its just a football game,5,0907,09,41866
football just football,4,0907,09,41867
yeah see you were all worried for nothing,5,0907,09,41868
it's football it's just football this is great this is the first time i've ever enjoyed football it may be customary to get a beer what the what are you doing,4,0907,09,41869
you don't wanna see what i just saw,5,0907,09,41870
what are you guys doing oh my god is that richard,3,0907,09,41871
oh you missed it she was laughing oh it was amazing it was amazing it was the most beautiful beautiful sound that,1,0907,09,41872
oh i know isn't it ooh what'd you do to get her to laugh,2,0907,09,41873
oh you know i just couple of things i tried i just sang a little doo itsy bitsy spider,1,0907,09,41874
you sang baby got back didn't you,2,0907,09,41875
nothing else worked that girl is all about the ass,1,0907,09,41876
and then it goes back to the chorus smelly cat sme lly ca t / i t's not your fau lt and that's the end of the song i realise that you didn't ask to hear it but uhm no one had spoken in seventeen minutes,6,0907,09,41877
phoebe writes lots of great songs wha what was that one you sang the other night that everybody just loved,0,0907,09,41878
no,0,0907,09,41879
oh ode to a pubic hair,6,0907,09,41880
stop,0,0907,09,41881
oh god is that veal,6,0907,09,41882
mom i thought i told you phoebe's a vegetarian,0,0907,09,41883
oh no no no no that's okay that's okay i mean i'm i am a vegetarian except for veal yeah no veal i love,6,0907,09,41884
phoebe you don't have to eat,0,0907,09,41885
no no no i actually it's any baby animals,6,0907,09,41886
so what do you think,0,0907,09,41887
so you stole that tape from richard's apartment,3,0907,09,41888
whoho ho listen to the judgement from the porn star,4,0907,09,41889
that tape was never meant to be seen by joey i would feel more comfortable if i was having this conversation in private,3,0907,09,41890
monica look i don't think you and i have any secrets anymore not ready to joke about it yet okay i see you later,5,0907,09,41891
why in the world would you take this tape and and why would you watch it,3,0907,09,41892
because that's who i am okay i'm sure a mature man like richard could see a tape like that and it wouldn't bother him just'd be another saucy anecdote for him to share at his men's club over brandy and moustaches,4,0907,09,41893
is all this about you not being able to grow a moustache,3,0907,09,41894
this is about you and richard he's clearly not over you he keeps a tape so he can look at it whenever he wants,4,0907,09,41895
isn't that sad i mean can you see how pathetic that is you shouldn't be jealous you should feel bad for him,3,0907,09,41896
oh yeah well poor richard y' i can grow a moustache,4,0907,09,41897
chandler this is not our problem we've got each other that's all that matters,3,0907,09,41898
yeah oh but i just keep picturing you rolling around with him with your cowboy boots in the air,4,0907,09,41899
cowboy boots i've never worn cowboy boots in my whole life,3,0907,09,41900
oh good good play more because i wanna see how it ends,4,0907,09,41901
that's not me,3,0907,09,41902
what that's not you life is good again ride 'em cowgirl,4,0907,09,41903
that bastard taped over me,3,0907,09,41904
is that a problem,4,0907,09,41905
i it's just so insulting big spring for a new blank tape doctor,3,0907,09,41906
i can't imagine what he sees in her,0,0907,09,41907
she actually makes me miss that pill popping ex wife of his oh hello dear,0,0907,09,41908
we were just chit chatting how's your friend,0,0907,09,41909
a little better,0,0907,09,41910
by the way do you know who's moving back into town tom and sue's daughter jen,0,0907,09,41911
you remember her michael she's lovely and well behaved and single,0,0907,09,41912
i'm not interested,0,0907,09,41913
oh please darling let's be honest you can have all the sailor fun you want with that one but let's be real,0,0907,09,41914
all right stop you know all phoebe has done tonight is trying to get you to like her and maybe that hasn't been clear all the time but she did her best and yeah she's a little different than you are,0,0907,09,41915
michael a pimp spit in her mouth,0,0907,09,41916
so what i mean if even i can get past that it shouldn't bother you and you don't have to like her you just have to accept the fact that i do i mean if you even can't be civil to the woman i love,0,0907,09,41917
the woman you what,0,0907,09,41918
yeah the woman you what,6,0907,09,41919
the woman i love i love you which is probably something i shouldn't say for the first time in front of my parents and tom and sue who are by the way the most sinfully boring i've ever met in my life,0,0907,09,41920
i love you too,6,0907,09,41921

pheebs i still need some help here,5,0908,09,42040
oh right ok um ok so its not just the lie you tell but its the way you tell it for example if you look down at the ground when you're talking people know you're lying,6,0908,09,42041
oh i don't know why this is so hard for me you know i mean lying is basically just acting and i am a terrfic actor,5,0908,09,42042
you are a terrific actor &lt;joey realizes what she's doing&gt;,0,0908,09,42043
hey hey where's the baby,0,0908,09,42044
oh we just put her down for a nap,1,0908,09,42045
oh i was just thinking you know what would be incredible if you guys died,0,0908,09,42046
thats a great movie &lt;she claps&gt; &lt;joey nods in agreement&gt;,6,0908,09,42047
now listen not that you guys could stop me or anything cause you know you'd be dead i was thinking about changing her name i'm just not really a big fan of emily,0,0908,09,42048
emma,2,0908,09,42049
emma ross wants you,0,0908,09,42050
phoe be,6,0908,09,42051
why does she keep making that noise,0,0908,09,42052
honey i don't know how to tell you this but um if something were to happen to ross or to myself &lt;ross and rachel knock on wood&gt; um you wouldn't get the baby,1,0908,09,42053
well we haven't offically asked them yet but we would want monica and chandler,2,0908,09,42054
i can't believe you'd want us to raise emma,4,0908,09,42055
yeah oh my god i'm so moved,3,0908,09,42056
i don't believe this hold on a second you guys die and i don't get your baby,0,0908,09,42057
see look amy we're a lot closer to monica and chandler we see them every day and truthfully honey you don't seem very connected to the baby,1,0908,09,42058
connected i mean to what she's she's a lump,0,0908,09,42059
&lt;points to chandler&gt; this guy seriously later in the day,0,0908,09,42060
okay it's time for dinner everyone we're using our fancy china um and its very expensive so please be careful,3,0908,09,42061
woah woah &lt;nearly really drops the plate and more seriously&gt; woah,0,0908,09,42062
okay just to be clear comedy with the plates will not be well recieved &lt;pinches ross' arm&gt; ross makes some sort of sound to let us know it hurt,3,0908,09,42063
hey how come my plate's less fancy then everyone else's do you not trust me with a fancy plate,5,0908,09,42064
no honey its thats a special plate see its a game whoever gets that plate wins,3,0908,09,42065
i can't believe i won,5,0908,09,42066
its such a slap in the face i'm your sister and you would give your baby to these strangers over me,0,0908,09,42067
monica is ross' sister,1,0908,09,42068
no ross' sister was really fat,0,0908,09,42069
that was me,3,0908,09,42070
no she was this really dorky girl in high school that used to follow rachel around like a puppy dog,0,0908,09,42071
hey amy you've got to stop doing that &lt;amy gets pissed and starts cutting food on the fancy plate very harshly you can hear the silveware scraping the fancy plate&gt;,1,0908,09,42072
now see this way you protect the plate and lets face it you have fun,3,0908,09,42073
okay how about this you guys die and the crazy plate lady dies then do i get the baby,0,0908,09,42074
no if crazy plate lad &lt;sees monica frustrated at this comment&gt; if monica dies then i would get emma right &lt;ross and rachel pause and ponder this&gt;,4,0908,09,42075
actually what,4,0908,09,42076
well its just its just in that case then um emma would go to my parents,2,0908,09,42077
what,4,0908,09,42078
hurts doesn't it &lt;chandler gives a look that says yeah &gt;,0,0908,09,42079
uh who has to die for me to get her &lt;everyone is looking around and at joey with looks of 'what ' on their faces&gt; commercial break,0,0908,09,42080
so if monica's not around then i'm not good enough to raise emma,4,0908,09,42081
no that that is not what we're saying,0,0908,09,42082
yeah he's lying he looked down &lt;joey looks to phoebe and she nods in agreement&gt;,5,0908,09,42083
well what is wrong with me am i am i incomptent because i managed to survive whatever it is that killed the three of you,4,0908,09,42084
honey you're taking this the wrong way we think you're going to be a wonderful parent it's just you're more the fun parent,1,0908,09,42085
yeah and we'd want to make sure emma has someone like monica who is more uh uh discliplinarin someone who can be firm and strict,2,0908,09,42086
thats not how you see me is it,3,0908,09,42087
no you're all about the fun,0,0908,09,42088
look i may not know a lot about babies but do you really think i'm not capable,4,0908,09,42089
no you both are equally capable its just you're strongest when when you're together,2,0908,09,42090
ok so if we both had emma and i die &lt;knocks on table&gt; she'd have to give her up,4,0908,09,42091
sure monica would have to give her up,2,0908,09,42092
i lie better then that right,5,0908,09,42093
so let me get this straight so my two friends die i get emma then my wife dies then emma the one tiny ray of hope left in my life gets taken away from me,4,0908,09,42094
there's your movie &lt;claps&gt; later on monica opens her front door chandler is sitting in the hallway,6,0908,09,42095
hey there you are you disappeared after dinner,3,0908,09,42096

ross and rachel don't know what they're talking about i mean its not like their so responsible emma is a product of a bottle of merlot and a five year old condom,3,0908,09,42098
yeah but they're right i mean i'm not a strong father figure and i never will be,4,0908,09,42099
no you learn these things you grow into it,3,0908,09,42100
yeah but its not who i am everything they said was exaclty why i was worried about having a kid and its true and look everybody knows it,4,0908,09,42101

joey listen i can't do this it doesn't make any sense yesterday i was a nurse and today i'm a waitress at a cafe,6,0911,09,42787
oh sometimes we use the same extras for different parts it's okay,5,0911,09,42788
well it's not okay because i gave a very memorable performance as the nurse and now suddenly i'm the waitress that's gonna confuse my fans,6,0911,09,42789
maybe you are a nurse but you moonlight as a waitress,5,0911,09,42790
uhuh because i'm a single mother supporting my two children,6,0911,09,42791

i'll watch her,0,0911,09,42815
why would you do that,1,0911,09,42816
because you've worked really hard and it's your job and you're a little crazy,0,0911,09,42817
i should tell you that crying women make me very uncomfortable,0,0911,09,42818

hey listen pheebs i was just talking to the director and he was thinking maybe this time you don't hit drake you just wait on the tables,5,0911,09,42824
i can't do that i'm an actor i have a process,6,0911,09,42825
you're a masseuse you have a table with a hole in it,5,0911,09,42826
wait a minute i see what's happening here you're threatened,6,0911,09,42827

yeah you can fire her but i would call security she won't go easy,5,0911,09,42830
you faked it you couldn't have faked it,3,0911,09,42831
oh yes you can you just make the faces and the noises,4,0911,09,42832
guys can fake it unbelievable the one thing that's ours besides why would you fake it when we're trying to have a baby,3,0911,09,42833
that's actually why look i'm starting a whole new career now and i'm not saying that i don't want to have a baby i'm just saying maybe we could wait a little while,4,0911,09,42834
like a month,3,0911,09,42835
or a year,4,0911,09,42836
really you want to wait a year,3,0911,09,42837
"it could be less than a year i mean you've heard my stuff ""pants like shorts but longer "" it'll probably be more than a year",4,0911,09,42838
i really wanna have a baby,3,0911,09,42839

should we go make a baby right now before you change your mind,4,0911,09,42844
oh and i promise i will not fake it this time,4,0911,09,42845

well not so much a pet as you know an occasional visitor who i put food out for you know kinda like santa except santa doesn't poop on the plate of cookies,6,0912,09,42881
you can't keep a rat in your appartment they're extremely unsanitary and they transmit leptospirosis and hantavirus,0,0912,09,42882
what are those,6,0912,09,42883
i don't know but they don't sound like spa treatments you have to get rid of it,0,0912,09,42884
ok fine if it means that much to you i'll get rid of bob,6,0912,09,42885
so weird you think he's so gross and you're willing to eat his crackers,6,0912,09,42886
gavin i just wanted to say thank you again for watching emma yesterday during the presentation i really owe you an appology,1,0912,09,42887
for what,0,0912,09,42888
well when we first met you know i thought you were pompous and arrogant and obnoxious,1,0912,09,42889
is this your first appology,0,0912,09,42890
no i just mean that you know first impressions don't mean anything and i i think you're a really good guy and i'm sorry that i misjudged you,1,0912,09,42891
hello but you know what hey new day new leaf i am just really really happy i'm sorry obviously heather's ass has something more important to say so i'll just wait 'till it's finished,1,0912,09,42892
what,0,0912,09,42893
i was giving you an appology and you were totally checking her out,1,0912,09,42894
i wasn't checking her out i'm in fashion i was looking at her skirt or was it pants i didn't really see what happened below the ass area,0,0912,09,42895
oh wow you are really you're really a creep,1,0912,09,42896
why do you even care if i was looking at her are you jealous,0,0912,09,42897
oh yeah i'm jealous oh gavin please please look at my ass stop looking at my ass i mean i just think you are totally inappropriate ok this is a work environment she's your subordinate,1,0912,09,42898
i thought it was ok when you slept with your old assistant tag,0,0912,09,42899
that is totally different for two reasons one i didn't know that you knew that and two i wasn't some creep staring at his ass we had a deap meaningful relationship,1,0912,09,42900
huh what's tag's last name,0,0912,09,42901
it was oh my god he didn't have a last name it was just tag you know like cher or you know moses,1,0912,09,42902
but it was a deap meaningful relationship,0,0912,09,42903
oh you know what my first impression of you was absolutely right you are arrogant you are pompous morgan morgan tag's last name was morgan huh,1,0912,09,42904
it was jones,0,0912,09,42905
yeah well what are you his boyfriend,1,0912,09,42906
man i wish i had a nanny like you,5,0912,09,42907
you mean when you were a baby,0,0912,09,42908
would you stop staring at her,3,0912,09,42909
i wasn't staring i was leering,4,0912,09,42910
what's the big deal with her maybe she's attractive in an obvious kind of way,3,0912,09,42911
yeah obvious beauty's the worst you know when it's right there in your face me i like to have to work to find someone attractive makes me feel like i earned it,2,0912,09,42912
looks like joey is doing allright with her,4,0912,09,42913
yeah hey that was nice of you guys to back off and let joey get the girl for once,3,0912,09,42914
i'm gonna take her back to the appartment,0,0912,09,42915
ok i'll be home right after work ok by emma wemma demma i love you wovyou dovyou,2,0912,09,42916
they've elected me to talk to you about the baby talk it's not so good,3,0912,09,42917
hey listen joey about molly i really prefer if you didn't go after her,1,0912,09,42918
why not,5,0912,09,42919
because it took us months to find a good nanny and i wouldn't want anything to you know drive her away,1,0912,09,42920
so what you think i'm just gonna sleep with her and never call her again and things are gonna get uncomfortable yeah sounds about right,5,0912,09,42921
come on there are plenty of other women out thereok just just forget about her ok just she's off limits,2,0912,09,42922
oh man why did have to go and say that for now that you told me i can't have it makes me want her even more,5,0912,09,42923
what are you a child,2,0912,09,42924
joey come on now for me please just just try to focus your sexual energy on someone else,2,0912,09,42925
fine,5,0912,09,42926
take me home,3,0912,09,42927
what are you doing,6,0912,09,42928
setting rat traps,0,0912,09,42929
to kill bob,6,0912,09,42930
no no to test his neck strength,0,0912,09,42931
no mike i don't want to kill him i thought we were just gonna capture him and and you know set him free in the country side where he can maybe meet a friendly possom and a wisecracking owl,6,0912,09,42932
ok ok i'll throw away the traps,0,0912,09,42933
i'll find bob i'll get him bob bob robert oh wait i think i hear him oh oh my god bob had babies bob's a mom,6,0912,09,42934
better think of a new name for him,0,0912,09,42935
i don't know i kinda like bob for a girl,6,0912,09,42936
i don't know i mean i'm not sure,0,0912,09,42937
oh my god we killed bob,6,0912,09,42938
maybe it wasn't bob maybe it was a mouse,0,0912,09,42939
suzie,6,0912,09,42940
whazzup,2,0912,09,42941
seriously dude 3 years ago,4,0912,09,42942
listen can you do me a favor i'm gonna be out today can you just keep an eye on joey make sure nothing happens between him and molly,2,0912,09,42943
wh no some woman who sounded a lot like joey called earlier and asked for her daughter the hot nanny,2,0912,09,42944
is this really your long term plan for me to run interference because i could get a job any day now,4,0912,09,42945
you do appear right on the cusp of something come on man i'm sure he'll lose interest in a week or two but for now can you please just do this for me,2,0912,09,42946
allright fine but don't blame me if it doesn't work because you know as well as i do that once joey sets his mind on something more often than not he's going to have sex with it,4,0912,09,42947
well we gotta do something ok nannies like her don't grow on trees,2,0912,09,42948
picturing that tree,4,0912,09,42949

ok last night after the party i saw rachel kissing that jerk from her office out on your balcony,2,0913,09,43070
"our balcony seriously that's so funny because i told monica we should put lights on our balcony and she said ""no no it's too cold nobody will go out there "" and i said ""maybe if we put some light out there they will""",4,0913,09,43071
right that's why i came over to talk about hum i saw rachel kissing some guy on your balcony even though there were no lights,2,0913,09,43072
so are you gonna talk to her,4,0913,09,43073

"you know when ""that's fine"" sounds true when someone yells it and spits",4,0913,09,43075
no no no good so you're moving on do you have any idea where you're moving,4,0913,09,43076
"i don't know i mean i have plenty of opportunity just just now there were some women at the coffee house smiled at me and then the other day on the subway a woman ""accidentally"" sat on my hand",2,0913,09,43077

it's just i'm not good at singing,3,0913,09,43095
oh what's the matter are you scared you're afraid i'm a better singer you're afraid i'm gonna beat you at singing,6,0913,09,43096

it was the end of the party you were probably ironing wrapping paper,6,0913,09,43106
oh yeah so how did you end up kissing,3,0913,09,43107
you know we were all alone and he was being really nice to me and oh and he gave me this scarf,1,0913,09,43108
i thought you hated him,3,0913,09,43109
you know honey there is a thin line between love and hate and it turns out that line is a scarf,1,0913,09,43110
so are you thinking of starting up something with this guy,3,0913,09,43111
i don't know it's so complicated i work with this guy you know i have the baby and i have ross and i just i don't know what to do and i have to be at the office and see gavin in ten minutes,1,0913,09,43112
sounds like you need to think about what you want talk to gavin and you definitely should talk to ross,3,0913,09,43113
or i could call in sick and not deal with it at all,1,0913,09,43114

uh clearly,2,0913,09,43310
and you know we said that we would we would live together as long as this makes sense an maybe this you know just doesnt make sense anymore,1,0913,09,43311

well i'll probably be back to pick her up around six but she's in the bedroom all ready to go but she did actually fall back to sleep so,1,0914,09,43321
she's probably exhausted from all that adorable screaming she did last night,5,0914,09,43322

no hey it's been great,5,0914,09,43324

wow so how are you,5,0914,09,43326
sure i mean do i wish me and rachel living together would have worked out of course you know i'm disappointed but it's not like it's a divorce,2,0914,09,43327
no it's not a divorce it is not a divorce anyway i think rachel and i need to you know get on with our lives maybe maybe start seeing other people,2,0914,09,43328

i'm fine i'm fine it's just it's just weird what's happening with her and ross you know yesterday he asked me to fix him up with somebody,5,0914,09,43336
oh my god rachel asked me if i knew anyone for her too,6,0914,09,43337
why are they doing this,5,0914,09,43338
i don't know they're so perfect for each other; it's crazy,6,0914,09,43339
you know what's crazy these jars what is it like two bites in here,5,0914,09,43340
i just wish they'd realise they should be together,6,0914,09,43341
i know i know and when they moved back in together i figured y'know that's where things were headed,5,0914,09,43342
i know they should be a family they should get married and have more children,6,0914,09,43343
yes and they should name one of their kids joey i may not have kids; someone's gotta carry on the family name,5,0914,09,43344
you know what maybe once they start dating and they see what's out there they'll realise how good they are for each other,6,0914,09,43345
yeah because it is slim pickings i had this date last night,5,0914,09,43346

yeah oh i know what we can do we could set ross and rachel up on horrible dates so that they'll realise how good they are together,6,0914,09,43349

honey i'm old,4,0915,09,43641
what's wrong,3,0915,09,43642
i am so much older than these other interns i can't compete with them,4,0915,09,43643
so you're a little older try to look at the positive,3,0915,09,43644
yes but i don't think life experience with these,4,0915,09,43645
wooooooooow it's like they're on fire,5,0915,09,43646
they're these prototype sneakers and come up with ideas on how to sell them which i can't do because no self respecting adult would ever where these,4,0915,09,43647
i give you $ 500 for them,5,0915,09,43648
what am i supposed to do with these,4,0915,09,43649
ah come on sneakers are easy you wear sneakers all the time,3,0915,09,43650

hey that'd work on me why did i get to buy mrs butterwords,5,0915,09,43654
hey you'll never guess what just happened phoebe and i got mugged,2,0915,09,43655
yah because phoebe knew the mugger,2,0915,09,43656

i'm sorry i have friends outside the six of us,6,0915,09,43658
you wanna know how she knew him because phoebe used to mug people,2,0915,09,43659
seriously,3,0915,09,43660
well i'm not proud of it but you know sometimes when i was living on the street and i needed money for food and stuff i,6,0915,09,43661
phoebe that is awful,3,0915,09,43662
well ok i wasn't rich like you guys ok i didn't eat gold and have a flying pony i had a hard life my mother was killed by a drug dealer,6,0915,09,43663

probably wanna know what i'm doing,5,0915,09,43706
no that seems about right,3,0915,09,43707
yesterday at my audition i really had to pee and apparently having to pee makes me a really good actor i got a call back so i'm drinking everything oh by the way that egg nog in our fridge was great,5,0915,09,43708
joey that was formula,1,0915,09,43709
we gotta get more of that,5,0915,09,43710
you know what these aren't half bad you should suggest something like these to ralph lauren,4,0915,09,43711
okay first of all that's stupid and second of all i'm not allowed to talk to ralph,1,0915,09,43712
alright i feel youger already,4,0915,09,43713
yah i think i broke my hip,4,0915,09,43714
no one ever asked me that what's wrong,2,0915,09,43715
nothing i really wanna know,6,0915,09,43716
oh well uhm there was actually a rather lively discussion about the pleistocene,2,0915,09,43717
alright nothing is worth this uhm i have a confession to make uhm okay you know that girl that mugged you when you were a kid,6,0915,09,43718
wh what are you talking about it wasn't a girl it was this huge dude,2,0915,09,43719

really even more humiliating than,6,0915,09,43728
hey let's not do this,2,0915,09,43729
and then at the end of the commercial the girls get out of the hut tub and start making out with each other,0,0915,09,43730
that's interesting just one thought,0,0915,09,43731
okay you start on the image of a guy putting on the shoes he's about my age,4,0915,09,43732
your age,0,0915,09,43733
a huh so he's rolling down the street and he starts to lose control you know maybe he falls maybe hurts himself just then a kid comes flying by wearing the shoes he jumps over the old guy and laughs and the line reads,4,0915,09,43734
chandler that's great,0,0915,09,43735
oh thank you sir or man who's two years younger than me,4,0915,09,43736
you see that has a clear selling point it appeals to our key demographic it's you did you come up with that,0,0915,09,43737
i don't know i don' i don' know i was just trying to get into a young mindset you know and it just started to flow,4,0915,09,43738

oh but you're finally doing something that you love i can't ask you to give that up though it'd be nice if the thing that you love was y'know finding gold,3,0916,09,43772

you're right there isn't a decent outlet,2,0917,09,44115

she's being unreasonable,5,0917,09,44129

please if i win the lottery you guys are not gonna leave me someone gave me a basket of mini muffins last week and i couldn't get rid of you for 3 days,3,0918,09,44341
chandler would you just tell her what she did was wrong,1,0918,09,44342
she's right you shouldn't have bought tickets just for us,4,0918,09,44343
ahhh,3,0918,09,44344

oh you guys we've got to keep all the tickets together,6,0918,09,44352
no no we should divide them up and i should get extra because we used my card to buy them,3,0918,09,44353
hey if anybody gets extra tickets it should be me this all thing was my idea,5,0918,09,44354
oh yeah thanks for inventing the lottery,4,0918,09,44355

can i ask you a question,1,0919,09,44611
have you ever had any weird romantic dreams,1,0919,09,44612
let me think oh when i was younger i used to dream that i got married to mayor mccheese and on our wedding night i ate his head,3,0919,09,44613
ok well this is like that in no way i had a i had a dream last night that i wanted to kiss joey,1,0919,09,44614
wow do you mean like kiss him kiss him,3,0919,09,44615
oh yeah i mean that was pretty intense,1,0919,09,44616
what do you think brought than on,3,0919,09,44617
i don't know i mean maybe that's something to do with the fact that i saw him do a love scene yesterday,1,0919,09,44618
a love scene with who,3,0919,09,44619
olivia,1,0919,09,44620
olivia i thought she was marrying connor oh right real life more important,3,0919,09,44621
so do you think that my dream means anything,1,0919,09,44622
i don't know i mean you saw him do a love scene so maybe you don't have a thing for joey maybe you have a thing for drake,3,0919,09,44623
ah well it was joey reading drake's lines in the dream,1,0919,09,44624
of course it was trust me when it comes to psychology i know what i'm talking about i took two psych classes in college,3,0919,09,44625

it was hard,3,0919,09,44627
here monica look what i got to wear when i play at the restaurant uh huh wait right i mean this might even class up the ballad of the uncircumcised man,6,0919,09,44628
oh phoebe maybe i wasn't clear before i really love listening to your music here but my restaurant is sort of an upscale place,3,0919,09,44629
right yeah ok i'll ask the butler to fetch my diamonds out of the vault,6,0919,09,44630
phoebe it's not what you wear it's sort of your songs i just don't think you should play at the restaurant anymore,3,0919,09,44631

phoebe come on i don't wanna waste it it would be like throwing away a hundred bucks,1,0921,09,44983
ok this is not about the money ok it's about it's about corporate greed destroying our hearts and leaving us the hollow shells,6,0921,09,44984

oh well you know what it probably is,0,0921,09,45114

oh chandler look you and monica are meant to have children i am sure it's gonna be just fine,0,0921,09,45116
oh oh yeah ok thanks i can't believe i didn't even think of that i guess i was just so worried about having to come here and do 'that',4,0921,09,45117
what you can do it in the parking lot of a taco bell but you can't do it at a doctor's office,0,0921,09,45118
it was a wendy's,4,0921,09,45119
ipan stripan glupi glabi and that is the swedish national anthem thank you for asking,6,0921,09,45120

yah she's uhm not very good though,1,0921,09,45122
uhu uhu and why do you think that is,6,0921,09,45123
i don't know maybe it's because she has got such callousy fingers from playing crummy guitar,1,0921,09,45124
or maybe she has trouble loosening your knots because you're such a high maintenance tight ass,6,0921,09,45125
phoebe,1,0921,09,45126
for like a half an hour man you can lie about sweden,1,0921,09,45127
how can you come here,6,0921,09,45128
how could you not tell me you worked here,1,0921,09,45129
i don't have to tell you everything,6,0921,09,45130
yes you do if you're going to make me feel guilty for getting a free massage,1,0921,09,45131
tips not included,6,0921,09,45132
oh phoebe why did you lie to me about working here,1,0921,09,45133
because i was ashamed ok i sold out for the cash and then they give me benefits like medical and dental and a 401k but you know you pay a price now i'm this corporate stooge and punching a clock and ugh paying taxes,6,0921,09,45134
phoebe honey if you hate it so much you should walk out there right now and quit be true to what you believe in honey you have principles and i so admire that i don't have any,1,0921,09,45135
you know what you are right i am gonna quit it's time i took my life back,6,0921,09,45136
okay if you guys have microphones in there too i didn't mean any of that i love you,6,0921,09,45137
haha got ya die die die,2,0921,09,45138
respectfully professor r geller hey,2,0921,09,45139
hey how was the met,2,0921,09,45140
the museum was amazing,0,0921,09,45141
yeah joey really knows his art huh,2,0921,09,45142
not so much no he had clearly memorized all the stuff to say and some of it didn't even make any sense,0,0921,09,45143
what do you mean,2,0921,09,45144
well for one he was talking about paintings that were nowhere around,0,0921,09,45145
wait a minute when you guys walked into the met did you go to the right,2,0921,09,45146
no we went to the left,0,0921,09,45147
oh joey joey but still i mean it seems like you guys are having a great time together,2,0921,09,45148
what,2,0921,09,45149
actually you know joey is your friend and you don't really know me that well; it would be weird,0,0921,09,45150
what i mean a little but no what go on,2,0921,09,45151
well i'm just thinking that maybe he's not the right guy to be with right now maybe i should be with someone i have more in common with you know what i mean,0,0921,09,45152
yeah but you know what i think you should give joey a chance i mean he's a great guy and sure he doesn't know that much about art but you know you can always talk about that with someone else,2,0921,09,45153
yeah i guess that's true,0,0921,09,45154
and if you think about it i mean the reason he memorized all that stuff is because he thought it was important to you you know that's the kind of guy joey is,2,0921,09,45155
he is very sweet plus he's hot,0,0921,09,45156
that was going to be my next argument,2,0921,09,45157
you're ready,5,0921,09,45158

actually it's both of us,4,0921,09,45167
what,3,0921,09,45168
apparently my sperm have low motility and you have an inhospitable environment,4,0921,09,45169
oh what does that mean,3,0921,09,45170
it means that my guys won't get off their barcaloungers and you have a uterus that is prepared to kill the ones that do it means,4,0921,09,45171
chandler,3,0921,09,45172
it means that we can keep trying but there's a good chance this may never happen for us,4,0921,09,45173
well we're gonna we're gonna figure this out,4,0921,09,45174

from cosmo,0,0922,09,45182
yeah yeah it's climax your way to better skin,1,0922,09,45183
so i have to go shopping today which is my least favourite thing i'm soo bad at picking out clothes,0,0922,09,45184
so you need someone who knows fashion to tell you what looks good,5,0922,09,45185
not me not me not me not me not me,1,0922,09,45186
maybe you could take charlie shopping,5,0922,09,45187
i'm sure you have better things to do,0,0922,09,45188
are you kidding rachel loves to shop and she has great taste yeah she's the one who taught me you don't wear white after labour day and that you always always always have to put on underwear when you're trying on clothes,5,0922,09,45189
if you have the time i'd really appreciate the help,0,0922,09,45190
ok uh uh let's let's shop,1,0922,09,45191
ok you're gonna come back with some very classy clothes and some slutty lingerie slutty,5,0922,09,45192
ok great all right bye pain in the ass that's off right,6,0922,09,45193
what's the matter pheebs,5,0922,09,45194
oh mike's sister just invited me to a party tonight he's gonna be there and she was like oh don't worry i asked him he's totally ok with seeing you so now i have to go so he'll think that i'm totally ok with seeing him,6,0922,09,45195
which you're not because you've totally hung up on him,1,0922,09,45196
exactly,6,0922,09,45197
and you're gonna want him to eat his heart out so you're gonna have to look fabulous,1,0922,09,45198
i didn't even think about that aaargh sexual politics,6,0922,09,45199
hey pheebs i'm i'm taking charlie shopping why don't you come and i'll help you find something,1,0922,09,45200
oh ain't that nice the three of you trying on slutty lingerie together,5,0922,09,45201
that's not what we're gonna do,1,0922,09,45202
why would you ruin it who was that hurtin' opening credits,5,0922,09,45203
wow fortunately she has a very pretty face,4,0922,09,45204
oh i so can't believe this my uterus is an inhospitable environment i was trying so hard to be a good hostess,3,0922,09,45205
oh i can't believe my sperm have low motility because let me tell you when i was growing up they sure seem to be in a hurry to get places,4,0922,09,45206
i'm sorry there wasn't better news from your test last week but i wanted to talk to you about your options,0,0922,09,45207
above all even though your chances of conceiving through natural means aren't great you never know so keep having sex on a regular basis,0,0922,09,45208
don't worry after a while he'll tune it out,3,0922,09,45209
ok given your situation the options with the greatest chances for success would be surrogacy or insemination using a sperm donor,0,0922,09,45210
and of course if you feel that neither of those is right for you you can always adopt,0,0922,09,45211
is that a hint because we love you doctor connelly but we don't think we'd want you to be our child wow talking about an inhospitable environment,4,0922,09,45212
hi ok you're ready to go pick up phoebe and go shopping,1,0922,09,45213
oh yeah let's do it,0,0922,09,45214
alright have a good time,5,0922,09,45215
not gonna find any clothes in there,1,0922,09,45216
guess who's up for keynote speaker at the national paleontology conference,2,0922,09,45217
umh kurts baley,0,0922,09,45218
yeah right what was last time he met a submission deadline for an abstract well why are you laughing,2,0922,09,45219
just seeing what it'd be like to be a paleontologist it's fun yeah,5,0922,09,45220
so you're up for keynote speaker who's making the decisions,0,0922,09,45221
professor sherman yeah i've a meeting with him today,2,0922,09,45222
he's a pretty tough guy to impress,0,0922,09,45223
yeah well i think i know how to dazzle him,2,0922,09,45224
oh you're not gonna do a magic trick are ya,1,0922,09,45225
tsz no,2,0922,09,45226
wait a minute you guys oh i wanna ask you something i i i may get to speak at this paleontology convention and if i do i'd love for you guys to come and hear me,2,0922,09,45227
i think i can safely say that we all have family issues work stuff and/or are sick,4,0922,09,45228
it's in barbados,2,0922,09,45229
but you come first,4,0922,09,45230
i'm there,1,0922,09,45231
we'll see you guys,0,0922,09,45232
all right so how did it go at the fertility clinic,5,0922,09,45233
not as much fun as last time apparently you only get porn if you're giving a sperm sample,4,0922,09,45234
so so what did the doctor say,2,0922,09,45235
well there's surrogacy but monica has dreamt her whole life of carrying a child she has felt that watching a surrogate would be too hard for her,4,0922,09,45236
so you're ruling out surrogacy,5,0922,09,45237
so i don't have to learn what that means,5,0922,09,45238
aside from adoption the only other choice is insemination so we're talking about sperm donors,4,0922,09,45239
enough said i'm there for you man where is she upstairs,5,0922,09,45240
ah ha,4,0922,09,45241
how do you feel about all this,2,0922,09,45242
i wish there was an easier way for us to have a child but i don't think there is one,4,0922,09,45243
come on ross be a good guy step up and do it,5,0922,09,45244
what,2,0922,09,45245

yeah you think so well should i ask him,4,0922,09,45394
no,3,0922,09,45395
why not just because his great grandmother was obese our kids are gonna get that from you anyway,4,0922,09,45396
no that's not it it's just that when we were asking him all those questions before i just i just realized i don't care if he's the most perfect guy in the world he's not you,3,0922,09,45397
no he's not and if i can't get pregnant with you then i don't want to get pregnant by him or anyone else,3,0922,09,45398
thank god because i don't wanna do this either you know i was just doing because i thought that was what you wanted to do you know i'm the husband i'm supposed to bring the sperm,4,0922,09,45399
that is so sweet i love you,3,0922,09,45400

see,3,0923-0924,09,45454
yeah that's the same as it has something to do with wind,4,0923-0924,09,45455

it's ok ho honest mistake,0,0923-0924,09,45461
really it doesn't mean anything i mean you know monica refers to chandler as richard all the time,6,0923-0924,09,45462

i wouldn't read too much into it,4,0923-0924,09,45471
still you know a girl calls you by your ex boyfriend's name that that's not a good thing right,0,0923-0924,09,45472
david let me stop you there because i think i see where this is going i'm not very good at giving advice so if you want advice go to ross monica or joey if the thing you wanna advice about is pizza toppings or burning sensation when you pee,4,0923-0924,09,45473

i'm sorry uh i just wish i could make her forget about mike already you know why did phoebe and mike break up,0,0923-0924,09,45476
oh because his penis was too big oh i'm sorry that's the kind of thing i do they broke up because mike didn't want to get married hey what if you just let phoebe know you'd be open to marriage,4,0923-0924,09,45477
that's great that's great i i'll propose to her,0,0923-0924,09,45478
what,4,0923-0924,09,45479
well i was probably going to do it at some point,0,0923-0924,09,45480

you really should have been more clear about that,5,0923-0924,09,45489
you're never going to guess who i just saw downstairs,2,0923-0924,09,45490
oh ah eh britney spears,5,0923-0924,09,45491
yeah she never misses these conferences no i just saw dr kenneth schwartz,2,0923-0924,09,45492

yeah what am i going to say to kenneth schwartz,2,0923-0924,09,45494
you could say,5,0923-0924,09,45495
ready to go,2,0923-0924,09,45496
wha you're gonna go now i thought we could hang out,5,0923-0924,09,45497

will you wear a thong,5,0923-0924,09,45500
i will if you will,0,0923-0924,09,45501
oh you got yourself a very weird deal,5,0923-0924,09,45502

yeah yeah i've got tons of stuff i could do i'm gonna hit the beach go swimming,5,0923-0924,09,45504

wow that mike thing was interesting i don't know what's gonna happen with phoebe and david,3,0923-0924,09,45509
i do want a hint huh i do i do,4,0923-0924,09,45510
ok i'm sensing that this is some kind of word play because you are pink with barely controlled glee,3,0923-0924,09,45511
david is going to propose to phoebe,4,0923-0924,09,45512
what why,3,0923-0924,09,45513
be cause we were talking about ways that he could beat mike and i told him that phoebe wanted to get married,4,0923-0924,09,45514
chandler we have talked about this you are not supposed to give people advice now couldn't you just have made some sort of inappropriate joke,3,0923-0924,09,45515

please you don't have to explain i mean perhaps if i hadn't gone to minsk things would have worked out for us and i wouldn't have ruined my career or lost that toe to frostbite it was a good trip,0,0923-0924,09,45701
is it ok if i hug you now,0,0923-0924,09,45702

the sun is out,3,0923-0924,09,45707
hey remember when i had corneas,4,0923-0924,09,45708
ok listen you go down to the pool and reserve the chairs and i'll get the magazines and the lotion,3,0923-0924,09,45709
ladies ross's speech is in 45 minutes,4,0923-0924,09,45710
nooo,1,0923-0924,09,45711
damn it,3,0923-0924,09,45712
walls are pretty thin guys,2,0923-0924,09,45713
then we have to await the data from recent mri scans and dna testing which call into question information gathered from years of simple carbon dating,2,0923-0924,09,45714
look at that woman sitting by the pool getting tan so leathery and wrinkled i'm so jealous,1,0923-0924,09,45715
finally factoring the profusion of new species recently discovered,2,0923-0924,09,45716
not to mention the cold sores,4,0923-0924,09,45717
and that's just the herbivores i'm not even gonna discuss the carnivores their heads are already too big which is ironic considering their stunted cerebral development,2,0923-0924,09,45718
but all kidding aside in much the same way that homo ergaster is now thought to be a separate species from homo erectus,2,0923-0924,09,45719
what,0,0923-0924,09,45720
he said erectus,5,0923-0924,09,45721
no he really said it,5,0923-0924,09,45722
and while there are certainly vast differences between these mesozoic fossiles and the example of homo erectus,2,0923-0924,09,45723
erectus,5,0923-0924,09,45724
homo,1,0923-0924,09,45725
in a very real way we can bring the mesozoic era into the 21st century thank you,2,0923-0924,09,45726
i thought it was wonderful,0,0923-0924,09,45727

and you know i wanted to ask charlie out since the day i met her,2,1001,10,45993
oh i know i know it's been really hard for you,1,1001,10,45994
anyway one thing lead to another and oh before you know it we were kissing i mean how angry do you think joey is gonna be,2,1001,10,45995

oh no have you thought about it how complicated this could get what about ross,6,1001,10,46005
well he's with charlie now,5,1001,10,46006

uhm you know once we're in the air and the captain turns off the seatbelt sign you feel free to roam about my cabin,6,1001,10,46064
you should be careful when checking your overhead bins because items may shift during,0,1001,10,46065

yeah i tried to gnaw myself free,3,1001,10,46182
so did you err did you tell ross,5,1001,10,46183
well i tried but then he had a shampoo related emergency so i guess now it's your turn again,1,1001,10,46184

you told him he's adopted,0,1002,10,46359
i'm so sorry but you should have a sign out there or something or at least whisper it to people when they come in the door owen doesn't know he's adopted and he also thinks that santa is real,4,1002,10,46360

that fake british woman is a real bitch but she sure can dance hey,4,1003,10,46603
hi hey listen can we ask you a question when you and monica first hooked up was it weird going from friends to more than that,1,1003,10,46604

no no no no i mean se x u ally,1,1003,10,46606

i can tell from your expressions that that's the good news you were hoping for well i'm gonna go continue to spread the joy,4,1003,10,46609
well just because it happened that way for them doesn't mean it has to happen that way for us,1,1003,10,46610
yeah yeah absolutely i mean just because something's difficult doesn't mean that you quit,5,1003,10,46611
yeah so we just keep trying and trying until we do it,5,1003,10,46612
yeah and if doesn't work then we'll be just one of those couples that never have sex,1,1003,10,46613

gee if only she were one and had no idea what the hell a birthday was,4,1004,10,46640
c'mon you guys this is really important to us,2,1004,10,46641
well i'm sorry but chandler and i could really use a weekend away you know to reconnect emotionally,3,1004,10,46642
there's this thing i really want us to do i read about it in maxim,4,1004,10,46643
well can't you just go to vermont the next day,1,1004,10,46644
yeah we want everyone to be there as much as i hate to delay your doing weird sex stuff to my little sister,2,1004,10,46645
and i mean you know you guys this is a big deal i mean how can we have her first birthday party without her aunt and her uncle,1,1004,10,46646
all right we'll stay we can just drive up after the party,3,1004,10,46647
fine but if we end up not doing this maxim thing because of this party,4,1004,10,46648
believe me that is not why we won't be doing that opening credits,3,1004,10,46649
you know pheebs when i was little on my birthday my daddy would hide a present in every room of the house and then he would draw a treasure map to help me find 'em all,1,1004,10,46650
oooh i love family traditions like that when uhm when ursula and i were kids on our birthday our stepdad would sell his blood to buy us food,6,1004,10,46651
hey i brought the camera for emma's video,2,1004,10,46652
oh good good we had this idea to make a birthday video for emma and we'll give it to her when she is 18,1,1004,10,46653
oh cool wow it's like a time capsule,6,1004,10,46654
oh just think she's gonna be watching that video on a tv that hasn't even been invented yet with friends who right now are just like babies and they'll be living in a floating city that the humans built to escape the ant people,6,1004,10,46655
that's the hope so is emma awake yet,2,1004,10,46656
oh no it's still nap time but she'll be up soon,1,1004,10,46657
ah and where is joey,2,1004,10,46658

i'm not going to vermont with this monica,4,1004,10,46687
hey pheebs you know what i was thinking since you wrote a song maybe i could do something for emma using my talents,5,1004,10,46688
so you're gonna hit on her,6,1004,10,46689
no no no my talents as an actor,5,1004,10,46690

or you could stick a fork in an apple,6,1004,10,46692
hey i think emma might like it,5,1004,10,46693
oh emma might like what,1,1004,10,46694

your ex boyfriend is insane,2,1006,10,47369
did you get the grant,0,1006,10,47370

what,0,1006,10,47372
yeah he wouldn't give me the grant because i wouldn't give you up,2,1006,10,47373
benji isn't in love with me i mean he broke up with me and besides he's a very ethical man,0,1006,10,47374
really is it ethical to ask someone in a grant review who was the voice of underdog,2,1006,10,47375
i'm sure he was just joking ross,0,1006,10,47376
if you don't believe me let's go talk to him okay i'm telling you he didn't ask me one paleontological question,2,1006,10,47377
seriously,0,1006,10,47378
oh i'm sorry no he did ask me one uhm how do you spell mboscodictiosaur,2,1006,10,47379

damnit,2,1006,10,47381
dr geller charlie what are you what are you doing here,0,1006,10,47382
i want you to tell her everything about the deal you tried to make with me about the crazy questions you wally cox that's the voice of underdog,2,1006,10,47383
like i tried to tell you in the interview ross this grant is not based on your knowledge of pretty useless trivia,0,1006,10,47384
no no no don't do that i want you to look her in the eyes and tell her the truth,2,1006,10,47385
benji,0,1006,10,47386
alright it's true i behaved horribly but it's only because i still love you and i would do anything to have you back in my life,0,1006,10,47387
too little too late benji,2,1006,10,47388
i never should have broken up with you i think about you all the time i mean do you ever still think about me,0,1006,10,47389
no,2,1006,10,47390
what,2,1006,10,47391
i don't know what to say benji this is all so romantic,0,1006,10,47392
or,2,1006,10,47393
listen i know i may be way out of bounds here but is there any chance you will take me back,0,1006,10,47394
maybe,0,1006,10,47395
sweetie this conversation is starting to make me a little uncomfortable,2,1006,10,47396
oh god i am so sorry but i mean it's there's so much history between us you know,0,1006,10,47397
i love you,0,1006,10,47398
i love you too,0,1006,10,47399

ha ha ha third time this week man this does not get old,1,1006,10,47402
you're mean,5,1006,10,47403
oh don't be such a baby,1,1006,10,47404
robert carlock and wendy knoller,0,1007,10,47405
hey what are you doing,2,1007,10,47406
oh figuring out our wedding plans,0,1007,10,47407
that's funny we were doing the same thing,4,1007,10,47408
it's really crazy the hall the dress the food i i had no idea how expensive this stuff was,6,1007,10,47409
yeah it is really pricey i mean i freaked when i first heard the numbers,4,1007,10,47410
so what did you two do about it,6,1007,10,47411
it was pretty simple actually i came up with a couple of cost cutting solutions wrote out a list and monica told me to go to hell,4,1007,10,47412
there's no way around it pheebs you just gonna have to accept the fact that this is gonna cost you a lot of money,2,1007,10,47413
i heard that weddings are like a 40 billion dollar a year industry,0,1007,10,47414
yeah and i'm responsible for just like half of that,2,1007,10,47415
but really it does seem like this money could be put to better use,6,1007,10,47416
are you serious,0,1007,10,47417
yeah now how would you feel if we gave all the wedding money to charity and we just got married at city hall,6,1007,10,47418
i think it would make me wanna marry you even more,0,1007,10,47419
i've got to say you guys that's an incredible gesture,2,1007,10,47420
maybe you do that next time you get married,4,1007,10,47421
no no no the next time it's gonna be a hawaii at sunset but maybe the time after that opening credits,2,1007,10,47422
what's going on,5,1007,10,47423
our adoption social worker is coming by today so we are cleaning the apartment,4,1007,10,47424
we,3,1007,10,47425
you know you don't want me to help you can't have it both ways,4,1007,10,47426
hey is this person who decides whether or not you get a baby,5,1007,10,47427
kind of she's coming by to interview us and see where we live,4,1007,10,47428
and it has to go perfectly because if she doesn't like something about us she can keep us off every adoption list in the state,3,1007,10,47429
hey maybe i should stop by she could be a soap opera fan it's very impressive when the little people know a celebrity,5,1007,10,47430
little people,4,1007,10,47431
celebrity,5,1007,10,47432
ok so i think i'm just about done here unless you have any bad stuff hidden somewhere like porn or cigarettes,3,1007,10,47433
what no,4,1007,10,47434
chandler,3,1007,10,47435
i don't and i'm offended by the insinuation,4,1007,10,47436
ok so there's not a magazine under the couch or a pack of cigarettes taped to the back of the toilet tank or a filthy video in the vcr,3,1007,10,47437
i'll admit to the cigarettes and the magazine but that tape is not mine,4,1007,10,47438
it isn't mine,3,1007,10,47439
well i guess we'll never know whose it is,5,1007,10,47440
may i help you,0,1007,10,47441
yes we're here to make a rather sizeable donation to the children,6,1007,10,47442
well any contribution large or small is always appreciated,0,1007,10,47443
well i think you're gonna appreciate it the crap out of this one,6,1007,10,47444
well this is very generous,0,1007,10,47445
and we don't want any recognition this is completely anonymous,6,1007,10,47446

ross those things go like 40 miles an hour ok when you're and there is that moment when you are at the top when you just don't know if you're gonna return back to earth,1,1007,10,47475
space is filled with orbiting children look please just come on you know when you'll see the look on emma's face i swear you won't regret it,2,1007,10,47476
good you don't want to be one of those mothers who pass on their irrational fears on their children do you,2,1007,10,47477
irrational huh all right well i'll remember that the next time you freak out about a spider in your apartment,1,1007,10,47478

and a lot could still get in our way,3,1009,10,47931
yeah i mean this girl could decide against adoption or she could like another couple better,4,1009,10,47932
what are you gonna name the baby,6,1009,10,47933
i can develop a condition in which i talk and talk and no one hears a word,4,1009,10,47934
but just think ok what if everything goes right what if this woman does pick you guys,5,1009,10,47935
oh my god she's gonna pick us,3,1009,10,47936
so we're standing firm on the 'not getting our hopes up',4,1009,10,47937

gosh you know you're just such an amazing couple it's kind of intimidating,0,1009,10,47979
i don't know about that,3,1009,10,47980
you're kidding me i mean it's enough that you are a doctor but on top of it you're married to a reverend,0,1009,10,47981
i don't think that's exactly,4,1009,10,47982
let her finish doctor,3,1009,10,47983
oh my friend sarah had a great time last night,6,1009,10,47984
yeah so you're gonna call this one back,6,1009,10,47985

oh really you know what your great friend did we're out to dinner ok we're getting along having a really nice time i was thinking she was really cool and then out of nowhere,5,1009,10,47988
that's it that's why you won't go out with her again so she took some fries big deal,6,1009,10,47989
hey hey look it's not about a few fries it's about what the fries represent,5,1009,10,47990
what,6,1009,10,47991
all food,5,1009,10,47992
i'm sorry i can't believe i set you up with such a monster,6,1009,10,47993
hey hey hey hey look i take a girl out she can order whatever she wants the more the better all right just don't order a garden salad and then eat my food that's a good way to lose some fingers,5,1009,10,47994
thank god you're here listen to this,6,1009,10,47995
what,1,1009,10,47996
joey and my friend were out last night and having dinner and she reaches over and takes a few of his fries,6,1009,10,47997
what you know about the plate thing,6,1009,10,47998
oh yeah joey doesn't share food i mean just last week we were having breakfast and he had a couple of grapes on his plate and,1,1009,10,47999
you wouldn't let her have a grape,6,1009,10,48000
oh no not me emma,1,1009,10,48001
joey doesn't share food,5,1009,10,48002
well i still think that it's a stupid reason not to call someone again you are calling her and if you need to just get an extra plate of fries for the table,6,1009,10,48003
i like that a sharing buffer yeah i'll order some extra fries maybe a plate of onion rings yeah and a shrimp cocktail and some buffalo wings maybe an individual pizza uh and some mozzarella sticks what were we talking about,5,1009,10,48004
you know we should just go i'm not gonna find anything here this stuff is ridiculous,2,1009,10,48005
ah this place is great,1,1009,10,48006
rach come on i'm not gonna wear any of this nothing silver ok nothing with hair and nothing with padlocks on it,2,1009,10,48007
ross look i know that some of this stuff is out there but i mean come on look at this look at this sweater i mean this is just beautiful,1,1009,10,48008
wow this is really soft three hundred and fifty dollars,2,1009,10,48009
yeah down from seven hundred you are saving like two hundred bucks,1,1009,10,48010
both logic and math are taking a serious hit today,2,1009,10,48011
hey check this out it's totally you,0,1009,10,48012
actually this looks like pretty good yeah boys will be boys,2,1009,10,48013
all right that's it i'm getting out of here,2,1009,10,48014
no no no no ross wait come on you know there's other stuff here's a nice shirt look at these nice pants,1,1009,10,48015
uh actually these might look pretty good on me,2,1009,10,48016
yes they will you know what you should do just go take a walk all right i know your size and i'm i'm gonna pick up some really good stuff for you,1,1009,10,48017
yes and i know what looks sexy on guys please just wear what i suggest and she's gonna go nuts for you,1,1009,10,48018
so you're saying uh if i wear these pants i might be getting into hers,2,1009,10,48019
why do men keep talking to me like this,1,1009,10,48020
so the fact that i am a doctor and my wife's a reverend that's important to you,4,1009,10,48021
"yeah i read some great applications but then i thought ""who better then a minister to raise a child """,0,1009,10,48022
amen,3,1009,10,48023
plus i thought the baby would be in good hands with a doctor,4,1009,10,48024
uh good hands healing hands,3,1009,10,48025
reverend can i ask does the bible say anything about adoption,0,1009,10,48026
"it says ""do it "" and behold she did adopt onto them a baby and it was good",3,1009,10,48027
i was wondering you both have such serious jobs would you have time to take care of a baby and your flock,0,1009,10,48028
oh you know my flock is good i mean yeah my flock pretty much takes care of themselves at this point good flock flock flock flock,3,1009,10,48029
being a doctor must take up a lot of time,0,1009,10,48030
no ot for me it doesn't,4,1009,10,48031
so how's everything going in here,0,1009,10,48032
we're great i think i may have asked all my questions,0,1009,10,48033
do you have any question for erica,0,1009,10,48034
yeah actually so you read a file that you liked and you gave the agency the serial number and they contacted us,4,1009,10,48035
yes our system assures total anonimity we're very proud of it,0,1009,10,48036
you should be you're really on top of stuff,4,1009,10,48037
well then if there's nothing else then the two of us should talk,0,1009,10,48038
actually i don't think we have to,0,1009,10,48039
we don't,3,1009,10,48040
yeah when i read about you two i was pretty sure i wanted you but i just thought we should meet face to face i've made my decision i choose them,0,1009,10,48041
oh my god this is great this is so great did you hear that,3,1009,10,48042
hey thank you thank you so much you are so going to heaven,3,1009,10,48043
we got some really great stuff,1,1009,10,48044
yeah yeah but i am not sure about some of the bra's i got,6,1009,10,48045
oh really do you wanna try some of them on for me,1,1009,10,48046
oh okay wait are we in joey's imagination,6,1009,10,48047
oh no i took one of ross' bags by mistake and one of mine is missing,1,1009,10,48048
oh well ross probably has it you can get it from him later,6,1009,10,48049
so what do you think,2,1009,10,48050
i think were not wearing the same shirt anymore,5,1009,10,48051
yeah yeah rachel picked it out for me she told me to trust her and you know what i'm glad i did i turned quite a few heads on my way over here,2,1009,10,48052
dude i really don't think you should be wearing that,5,1009,10,48053
oh i see somebody is afraid of a little competition with the ladies,2,1009,10,48054
looks like someone is the ladies,5,1009,10,48055
you're just jealous because you couldn't pull this off yeah now if you'll excuse me i have a date see all eyes on me,2,1009,10,48056
we are not signing those papers,4,1009,10,48057
why not,3,1009,10,48058
it's wrong they made a mistake they think we're somebody else,4,1009,10,48059
god works in mysterious ways,3,1009,10,48060
you have gotta stop,4,1009,10,48061
but she liked us,3,1009,10,48062
she likes doctor chandler and reverend monica,4,1009,10,48063
well if you think about it i am kind of like a reverend i mean as a chef i serve god by feeing the hungry and poor,3,1009,10,48064
your veal chop is $34 95,4,1009,10,48065
c'mon chandler i think we have been given an opportunity i mean the mistake has already been made they are writing up the paper right now,3,1009,10,48066
but we are not the one she chose how can you feel okay about this,4,1009,10,48067
because we may not be who she thinks we are but no one will ever love that baby more than us,3,1009,10,48068
i mean who knows how long it's gonna take for someone else to give us a baby what if what if no one ever picks us,3,1009,10,48069
please please we are so close,3,1009,10,48070
monica i want a baby too but this woman is giving away her child she deserves to know who it's going to,4,1009,10,48071
so we'll tell the truth and who knows maybe she'll like us for us,4,1009,10,48072
maybe she will uh why couldn't i have been a reverend,3,1009,10,48073

oh sure yeah well he was my high school boyfriend captain of the football team really cute and he got a scholarship and went off to college,0,1013,10,49080
that's great,4,1013,10,49081
yeah it's almost definitely him,0,1013,10,49082
how's that now,3,1013,10,49083
well there is a chance it's another guy i mean i have only ever been with two guys but they sorta overlapped,0,1013,10,49084
so what does the other guy do does he go to college too,4,1013,10,49085
no he's in prison,0,1013,10,49086
was he falsely accused of something,3,1013,10,49087
no he killed his father with a shovel but other than that he's a great guy,0,1013,10,49088
i'll bet his dad doesn't think so,4,1013,10,49089
are you awake,3,1013,10,49090
of course i'm awake assume from now on that i'm always awake,4,1013,10,49091
alright we don't know that it's him i mean it could be the football guy,3,1013,10,49092
honey it's us of course it's the shovel killer,4,1013,10,49093
alright lets say that it is him would we not want the baby no would we treat him any differently,3,1013,10,49094
i'd keep an eye on him we have to find out which one the father is,4,1013,10,49095
how,3,1013,10,49096
i dunno aren't there tests for these things right,4,1013,10,49097
yeah but maybe we're just over reacting,3,1013,10,49098
pff easy for you to say he's a father killer he probably loves him mommy he's probably got a tattoo that says mom on his shovel wielding arm,4,1013,10,49099
we will now count from one to five un deux trois quatre cinq,0,1013,10,49100
huh un blu bla flu flenk,5,1013,10,49101

hey phoebe hey tell me what you think all right the house next door to the one that we're buying in westchester just went on the market i wanna take a look at it but chandler doesn't,3,1015,10,49502
we close escrow tomorrow so seeing another house can only confuse us and we're easily confused we're not very bright,4,1015,10,49503
but what if it is better than ours should we at least look,3,1015,10,49504
what do you think pheebs,4,1015,10,49505
well i think that shirt makes you look like you should work at a baskin robbins anyway hey isn't joey's agent estelle leonard,6,1015,10,49506
she died,6,1015,10,49507
you're kidding,4,1015,10,49508
that's terrible,3,1015,10,49509
yeah last saturday wow she was the first black man to fly solo across the atlantic oh wait a minute i read the wrong one,6,1015,10,49510
yeah she was just an agent,6,1015,10,49511
joey's gonna be *so* upset,3,1015,10,49512
i know *he* always wanted to be the first black man to cross the atlantic,4,1015,10,49513
well we cannot tell joey about this he's already flipping out about everything that's changing this will push him over the edge,6,1015,10,49514
seriously you don't think we should tell him,3,1015,10,49515
well not for a little while let's just give him a few days to get used to everything else,6,1015,10,49516
what if he reads it in the paper,3,1015,10,49517
unless snoopy says it to charlie brown i think we're okay,4,1015,10,49518
may i help you,0,1015,10,49519
yeah i'm a friend of rachel green's uhm actually we met at the christmas party about two years ago,2,1015,10,49520
close ron,2,1015,10,49521
uh what can i do for you,0,1015,10,49522
uhm well i'm here to see if you'll give rachel her job back,2,1015,10,49523
ah did she ask you to come here and do this,0,1015,10,49524
oh no at first i have to get you to agree then we'll see if she wants to come back,2,1015,10,49525
look she loved her job here and let's face,2,1015,10,49526
you're not gonna find anyone who did it as well as she did it isn't that true,0,1015,10,49527
huh i took a shot there,2,1015,10,49528
but i'm sorry there's nothing i can do ah it's not true there is nothing i want to do,0,1015,10,49529
i see thanks very much is this your son,2,1015,10,49530
yeah his name is ross what,0,1015,10,49531
oh nothing it's just it's close to ron does he does little ross like dinosaurs by any chance,2,1015,10,49532
yeah they're all he talks about why,0,1015,10,49533
you can really arrange that,0,1015,10,49534
you let rachel come back and it's done,2,1015,10,49535
well i guess having rachel back wouldn't be the worst thing in the world,0,1015,10,49536
yeah yes thank you this is great thank you so much and i swear your kid is going to have the time of his life,2,1015,10,49537
that's great i worry about little ross he's always reading he's collecting rocks and he's obsessed with dinosaurs,0,1015,10,49538
he'll be fine,2,1015,10,49539
i'm just mad at my agent,5,1015,10,49540
estelle why,6,1015,10,49541
there's a part in a tv movie that i would be perfect for and i didn't even be put up for it she'd better have a good reason,5,1015,10,49542
i'm guessing she does,6,1015,10,49543
well i'm wanna hear it because she keeps doing this,5,1015,10,49544
well no no wait wait wait all right i gotta go just listen promise me that you will wait a minute before you call her,6,1015,10,49545
because a promise between friends means never having to give a reason,6,1015,10,49546
i love that saying,5,1015,10,49547
joey it's estelle,0,1015,10,49548
i was just gonna call you that's weird,5,1015,10,49549
it's a little coincidental but believable listen i'm sure you're wondering why i didn't get you an audition for that tv movie,0,1015,10,49550
i guess i dropped the ball there whoopsie,0,1015,10,49551
that's it you know it seems all you do lately is drop the ball,5,1015,10,49552
don't take that tone with me who you think you are alan lemond the first black man to fly solo across the atlantic,0,1015,10,49553
no no look all i'm saying is that you're my agent ok and you're not getting me into any auditions and i'm tired of it,5,1015,10,49554
what are you saying,0,1015,10,49555
i'm saying that this isn't working for me anymore ok estelle you're fired goodbye,5,1015,10,49556
man tough week for estelle,6,1015,10,49557
emma left her stuffed t rex at my house you know she can't sleep without it,2,1015,10,49558
oh well she's asleep now stop forcing that thing on her,1,1015,10,49559
oh you're not gonna believe what happened to me today ralph lauren called and gave me my job back,1,1015,10,49560
nooo,2,1015,10,49561
yee i mean it was so weirdest thing they fired me and then out of nowhere they just hire me back i mean that place must have been falling apart without me,1,1015,10,49562
so you're not going to paris,2,1015,10,49563
no i'm still going,1,1015,10,49564
wh wh what,2,1015,10,49565
when the louis vuitton people found out that ralph lauren wanted me back the offered me more money isn't that great,1,1015,10,49566
yeeeah,2,1015,10,49567
hi we're buying the house next door and we were wondering if we could just take a look around,3,1015,10,49568
oh sure i'm showing it to someone else right now but please look around,0,1015,10,49569
it feels like we're cheating on our house and if we're gonna cheat shouldn't it be with like a hot younger house that does stuff that our house won't do,4,1015,10,49570
ours is so much better this living room is smaller the dining room looks like a cave what a hole,3,1015,10,49571
so what do you think,0,1015,10,49572
love it,3,1015,10,49573
well we already have one offer on it and i think the lady upstairs is goning to make another one,0,1015,10,49574
they could be our neighbors what are they like,3,1015,10,49575
oh the woman upstairs is very nice she and her husband have two kids he's on wall street and she,0,1015,10,49576
hey joey want come with me to are you ok,6,1015,10,49577
yeah i just i just feel bad about firing estelle this is got to be killing her,5,1015,10,49578
no that wouldn't kill her ordinary embolism might,6,1015,10,49579
no no no don't call her you wait for her to call you,6,1015,10,49580
why,5,1015,10,49581
because patience is the road to understanding which is the key to a happy heart,6,1015,10,49582
you blow me away,5,1015,10,49583
all right so promise you're gonna wait for her to call you,6,1015,10,49584
i promise and that means never having to give a reason,5,1015,10,49585
what a small world,0,1015,10,49586
and yet i never run into beyonce,4,1015,10,49587
you two know each other,0,1015,10,49588
oh we go way back before monica made an honest man out of him chandler used to be my little love muffin so are you guys thinking of getting this house too ooh are we gonna have a bidding war i'd better warn you i'm a toughie,0,1015,10,49589
don't don't,4,1015,10,49590
no actually we're buying the house next door,3,1015,10,49591
why,4,1015,10,49592
i d on't know why,3,1015,10,49593
ooh that decides it then i was on the fence but knowing that you two would be our neighbors ah now we have to get it ellen we're going to talk numbers,0,1015,10,49594
this can not be happening,4,1015,10,49595
okay the realtor said another couple made an offer maybe the janice's won't get it maybe the other couple will,3,1015,10,49596
the only way that that is going to happen is if the other couple are the hitlers,4,1015,10,49597
okay okay all right what if we got both houses huh we can turn this house into a guest house,3,1015,10,49598
that is a great idea and by the way i don't mean to sound distasteful but when did you start crapping money,4,1015,10,49599
okay you come up with an idea,3,1015,10,49600
alright alright we still have three hours till escrow closes on our house we can still get out,4,1015,10,49601
but we love our house,3,1015,10,49602
will we love it so much with her next door and she's gonna be louder out here too just the crickets and oh my god,4,1015,10,49603
well we have to do something we can't have her living next door oh that does it too,4,1015,10,49604
who is it,0,1015,10,49605
it's me ron look i um i now rachel turned you down but i think there is a way you might be able to get her to come back,2,1015,10,49606
this may surprise you but re hiring fired employees is not my main job,0,1015,10,49607
just hear me out how would you feel about offering her a raise,2,1015,10,49608
perhaps i can persuade you what if you can give your son this genuine pterodactyl egg replica,2,1015,10,49609
huh so we have a deal,2,1015,10,49610
this is gonna make me very popular,0,1015,10,49611
oh believe me the ladies they love it,2,1015,10,49612
i meant with my son,0,1015,10,49613
