"i don't believe this, hold on a second. you guys die and i don't get your baby?",0,0908,48636,09
"see look amy, we're a lot closer to monica and chandler. we see them every day. and truthfully honey, you don't seem very connected to the baby.",1,0908,48637,09

hey! how come my plate's less fancy then everyone else's? do you not trust me with a fancy plate?,5,0908,48643,09
"no, honey, its. thats a special plate. see its a game, whoever gets that plate wins.",3,0908,48644,09
i can't believe i won.,5,0908,48645,09
its such a slap in the face. i'm your sister and you would give your baby to these strangers over me.,0,0908,48646,09
monica is ross' sister.,1,0908,48647,09
"no, ross' sister was really fat.",0,0908,48648,09
that was me.,3,0908,48649,09
"no, she was this really dorky girl in high school that used to follow rachel around like a puppy dog.",0,0908,48650,09
"now see, this way you protect the plate.. and lets face it you have fun.",3,0908,48651,09
"okay, how about this, you guys die and the crazy plate lady dies, then do i get the baby?",0,0908,48652,09
"no, if crazy plate lad.. &lt;sees monica frustrated at this comment&gt; if monica dies then i would get emma, right? &lt;ross and rachel pause and ponder this&gt;",4,0908,48653,09
well actually...,1,0908,48654,09
actually what?,4,0908,48655,09
"well.. its just. its just in that case, then um. emma would go to my parents.",2,0908,48656,09
what?,4,0908,48657,09
"hurts, doesn't it? &lt;chandler gives a look that says yeah!&gt;",0,0908,48658,09
uh.. who has to die for me to get her? &lt;everyone is looking around and at joey with looks of 'what?' on their faces&gt; commercial break.,0,0908,48659,09
"so if monica's not around, then i'm not good enough to raise emma?",4,0908,48660,09
"no, that that is not what we're saying.",0,0908,48661,09
yeah he's lying. he looked down. &lt;joey looks to phoebe and she nods in agreement&gt;,5,0908,48662,09
well what is wrong with me? am i .. am i incomptent? because i managed to survive whatever it is that killed the three of you!,4,0908,48663,09
"honey, you're taking this the wrong way. we think you're going to be a wonderful parent. it's just.. you're more the fun parent.",1,0908,48664,09
yeah and we'd want to make sure emma has someone like monica who is more uh. uh discliplinarin.. someone who can be firm and strict.,2,0908,48665,09
"thats not how you see me, is it?",3,0908,48666,09
no you're all about the fun.,0,0908,48667,09
"look, i may not know a lot about babies, but do you really think i'm not capable?",4,0908,48668,09
"no, you both are equally capable. its just.. you're strongest when.. when you're together.",2,0908,48669,09
ok. so if we both had emma and i die &lt;knocks on table&gt; she'd have to give her up.,4,0908,48670,09
"sure, monica would have to give her up.",2,0908,48671,09
"i lie better then that, right?",5,0908,48672,09

hey. there you are. you disappeared after dinner.,3,0908,48674,09
oh? did somebody miss me? is there a child to raise poorly?,4,0908,48675,09
"yeah but they're right. i mean, i'm not a strong father figure and i never will be.",4,0908,48676,09
no you learn these things. you grow into it.,3,0908,48677,09
"yeah, but its not who i am. everything they said was exaclty why i was worried about having a kid. and its true. and look everybody knows it.",4,0908,48678,09
"oh yeah, well can you picture me saying go to your room! you're grounded?",4,0908,48679,09

you said that to me last week.,4,0908,48681,09
how hard is it? no shoes on the furniture. back to monica and chandler's apartment. amy is sitting on a chair by the bay window looking mad.,3,0908,48682,09
"oh, i like that, yeah. wasn't at the parade because i had a family emergency.",5,0908,48683,09
"ooh, what happened?",6,0908,48684,09

"oh, damn it!",4,0922,52132,09
"don't worry, after a while he'll tune it out.",3,0922,52133,09
"ok, given your situation, the options with the greatest chances for success would be surrogacy, or insemination using a sperm donor.",0,0922,52134,09
ok.,3,0922,52135,09
"and, of course, if you feel that neither of those is right for you, you can always adopt.",0,0922,52136,09
"is that a hint? because we love you doctor connelly but we don't think we'd want you to be our child!  wow, talking about an inhospitable environment!",4,0922,52137,09
"hi! ok, you're ready to go pick up phoebe and go shopping?",1,0922,52138,09

"yeah, well... i think i know how to dazzle him.",2,0922,52151,09

so so what did the doctor say?,2,0922,52165,09
"well... there's surrogacy, but monica has dreamt her whole life of carrying a child, she has felt that watching a surrogate would be... too hard for her.",4,0922,52166,09
so you're ruling out surrogacy?,5,0922,52167,09
yeah.,4,0922,52168,09
"so, i don't have to learn what that means?",5,0922,52169,09
